{{ icon_important_big_red }} This _Schedule Page_ is your main source of information for {{ module }}/T. You will need to refer to it weekly. 

More details for the upcoming weeks (and upcoming sections of the textbook) will be added as the weeks progress. In general, ==information given for more than 1 week into the future should be treated as _tentative_==.
