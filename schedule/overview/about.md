This _Schedule Page_ is your main source of information for {{ module }}/T. You will need to refer to it weekly. **More details for the upcoming weeks (and upcoming sections of the textbook) will be added as the weeks progress**; don't print/save content related to future weeks marked as :construction:.

**If you don't like the click-to-see-more style used by this website**, you can use an all-in-one version of the textbook in the [printable version]({{baseUrl}}/book/common/print.html) page and a similar version of admin info in the [Admin Page]({{baseUrl}}/admin/index.html).

**If you don't like the Web version at all**, a partial solution is to use the pdf version (available on IVLE) of the textbook used in the previous semesters. Caution: That file has not been updated since AY1617 and is slightly behind the Web version.
