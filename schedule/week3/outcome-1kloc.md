{{glyphicon_folder_close}} Evidence:

<include src="../week5/2kloc.md"/>

</panel>

</tip-box>

**Acceptable**: Evidence that you have worked with a code base larger than 1KLoC. %%e.g. a project in a previous module or a pet project%%

**Suggested**: Do an enhancement to [[AddressBook - Level1]({{module_org}}/addressbook-level1)]  %%e.g. add a new command%%

* The size of the enhancement does not matter.
* Change the code in small steps and commit after each significant change.
* Remember to update all relevant documentation and tests.
* Try to follow the coding standard in your new code.
* Try to stay within the procedural (not OOP) style of the code base.
* [Optional] Fork address [AddressBook - Level1]({{module_org}}/addressbook-level1) to your GitHub account and push your changes to your fork.
