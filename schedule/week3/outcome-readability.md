Evidence of applying these guidelines to some code (e.g. to addressbook-level1). i.e. for each guideline, have either 
* a commit showing how the application of the guidelines required a change to the code
* a piece of code that you identified as clearly following the guideline (and explain how the code would be if the guideline was not followed).
