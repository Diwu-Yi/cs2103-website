                          <p><strong>The <em>service-oriented architecture</em> (SOA) style builds applications by combining functionalities packaged as <em>programmatically accessible services</em></strong>. SOA aims to achieve interoperability between distributed services, which may not even be implemented using the same programming language. A common way to implement SOA is through the use of <em>XML web services</em> where the web is used as the medium for the services to interact, and XML is used as the language of communication between service providers and service users.</p>

Using these web services, an ‘eBookShop’ web application can be developed that allows HSBC customers to buy merchandise from Amazon and pay for them using HSBC credit cards. Because both Amazon and HSBC services follow the SOA architecture, their web services can be reused by the web application, even if all three systems use different programming platforms.</p>

                                    <p>Assume you are designing a multiplayer version of the Minesweeper game where any number of players can play the same Minefield. Players use their own PCs to play the game. A player scores by deducing a cell correctly before any of the other players do. Once a cell is correctly deduced, it appears as either marked or cleared for all players.</p>
                                    <p>Comment on how each of the following architectural styles could be potentially useful when designing the architecture for this game.</p>

                                        <li>Transaction-processing – Each player action can be packaged as transactions (by the client component running on the player PC) and sent to the server. Server processes them in the order they are received.</li>
                                        <li>SOA – The game can access a remote web services for things such as getting new puzzles, validating puzzles, charging players subscription fees, etc.</li>
                                        <li>Multi-layer – The server component can have two layers: logic layer and the storage layer.</li>

                          <p><strong><em>Agile design</em> can be contrasted with <em>full upfront design</em> in the following way</strong>:</p>
                          <blockquote>
                            <p><strong>Agile designs are emergent, they’re not defined up front.</strong> Your overall system design will emerge over time, evolving to fulfill new requirements and take advantage of new technologies as appropriate. Although you will often do <strong>some initial architectural modeling at the very beginning</strong> of a project, this will be just enough to get your team going. This approach does not produce a fully documented set of models in place before you may begin coding. <sub>-- adapted from <a href="http://agilemodeling.com/essays/agileDesign.htm">agilemodeling.com</a></sub></p>

                          <p>Given below are three commonly used team structures in software development. Irrespective of the team structure, it is a good practice to assign roles and responsibilities to different team members so that someone is clearly in charge of each aspect of the project. In comparison, the ‘everybody is responsible for everything’ approach can result in more chaos and hence slower progress.</p>

                          <p></p>
                          <p><strong>Egoless team</strong></p>
                          <p>In this structure, <strong>every team member is equal in terms of responsibility and accountability</strong>. When any decision is required, consensus must be reached. This team structure is also known as a <em>democratic</em> team structure. This team structure usually finds a good solution to a relatively hard problem as all team members contribute ideas.</p>
                          <p>However, the democratic nature of the team structure bears a higher risk of falling apart due to the absence of an authority figure to manage the team and resolve conflicts.</p>
                          <p><strong>Chief programmer team</strong></p>
                          <p>Frederick Brooks proposed that software engineers learn from the medical surgical team in an operating room. In such a team, there is always a chief surgeon, assisted by experts in other areas. Similarly, in a chief programmer team structure, <strong>there is a single authoritative figure, the chief programmer</strong>. Major decisions, e.g. system architecture, are made solely by him/her and obeyed by all other team members. The chief programmer directs and coordinates the effort of other team members. When necessary, the chief will be assisted by domain specialists e.g. business specialists, database expert, network technology expert, etc. This allows individual group members to concentrate solely on the areas where they have sound knowledge and expertise.</p>
                          <p>The success of such a team structure relies heavily on the chief programmer. Not only must he be a superb technical hand, he also needs good managerial skills. Under a suitably qualified leader, such a team structure is known to produce successful work. .</p>
                          <p><strong>Strict hierarchy team</strong></p>
                          <p>In the opposite extreme of an egoless team, a strict hierarchy team has <strong>a strictly defined organization among the team members</strong>, reminiscent of the military or bureaucratic government. Each team member only works on his assigned tasks and reports to a single “boss”.</p>
                          <p>In a large, resource-intensive, complex project, this could be a good team structure to reduce communication overhead.</p>

                                              <span class="dimmed">It's similar to giving extra details as appendices; the reader will look at the UG/DG if the PPP is not enough to make a judgment. For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></li>

                                    <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                                    <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                      <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                                      <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                                      <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                                      <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                                      <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                                      <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                                      <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>

For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></li>

                                    It is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated tests you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much.<br>
                                    There is no direct penalty for removing GUI tests. Also note <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:appEworkflow-testingExpectations">our expectation on test code</trigger>.</p>

                                      <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                                      <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                                      <ol>
                                        <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                                        <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                                        <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                                        <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                                        <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                                        <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                                        <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>

                              <p><strong>We can write user stories on</strong> index cards or sticky notes, and arrange on walls or tables, to facilitate planning and discussion. Alternatively, we can use a software (e.g., <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/">GitHub Project Boards</a>, Trello, Google Docs, ...) to manage user stories digitally.</p>

                        <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early stages of requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
                        <tip-box>
                          <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br>
                              Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
                            <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong>
                              Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
                            <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br>
                              Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br>
                              For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>
                              When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br>
                              When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br>
                              When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>

For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></li>

You an switch to a simpler workflow if the forking workflow is slowing you down. Refer the textbook to find more about alternative workflows: <em>branching workflow</em>, <em>centralized workflow</em>. However, we still recommend that you use PR reviews, at least for PRs affecting others' features.</p>

                                      <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                                      <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                                      <ol>
                                        <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                                        <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                                        <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                                        <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                                        <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                                        <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                                        <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>
                                      </ol>

For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></li>

                                        <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                          <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                                          <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                                          <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                                          <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                                          <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                                          <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                                          <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>

                                <p><strong>We can write user stories on</strong> index cards or sticky notes, and arrange on walls or tables, to facilitate planning and discussion. Alternatively, we can use a software (e.g., <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/">GitHub Project Boards</a>, Trello, Google Docs, ...) to manage user stories digitally.</p>

                          <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early stages of requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
                          <tip-box>
                            <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br>
                                Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
                              <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong>
                                Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
                              <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br>
                                Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
                              <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br>
                                For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>
                                When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
                              <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br>
                                When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
                              <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br>
                                When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>

UML is the brainchild of three software modeling specialists James Rumbaugh, Grady Booch and Ivar Jacobson (also known as the Three Amigos). Each of them has developed their own notation for modeling software systems before joining force to create a unified modeling language (hence, the term ‘Unified’ in UML). UML is currently the <em>de facto</em> modeling notation used in the software industry.</p>

                <li>
                  <p><strong>Third, if you care about your grade and willing to work for it, you need to take initiative</strong> to turn the situation around or else the whole team is going to suffer. Don't hesitate to take charge if the situation calls for it. By doing so, you'll be doing a favor for your team. Be professional, kind, and courteous to the team members, but also be firm and assertive. It is your grade that is at stake. Don't worry about making a bad situation worse. You won't know until you try.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Finally, don't feel angry or 'wronged'.</strong> Teamwork problems are not uncommon in this module and we know how to grade so that you will not be penalized for others' low contribution. We can use Git to find exactly what others did. It's not your responsibility to get others to contribute.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Given below are some suggestions you can adopt if the project work is not going smooth due to team issues. Note that the below measures can result in some team members doing more work than others and earning better project grades than others. It is still better than sinking the whole team together.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Redistribute the work</strong>: Stronger programmers in the team should take over the critical parts of the code.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Enforce stricter integration workflow</strong>: Appoint an integrator (typically, the strongest programmer). His/her job is to maintain the integrated version of the code. He/she should not accept any code that breaks the existing product or is not up to the acceptable quality standard. It is up to others to submit acceptable code to the integrator. Note that if the integrator rejected your code unreasonably, you can still earn marks for that code. You are allowed to submit such 'rejected' code for grading. They can earn marks based on the quality of the code.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>If you have very unreliable or totally disengaged team members</strong> :</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Re-allocate to others any mission-critical work allocated to that person so that such team members cannot bring down the entire team.</li>
                <li>However, do not leave out such team members from project communications. Always keep them in the loop so that they can contribute any time they wish to.</li>
                <li>Furthermore, evaluate them sincerely and fairly during peer evaluations so that they do get the grade their work deserves, no more, no less.</li>
                <li>Be courteous to such team members too. Some folks have genuine problems that prevent them from contributing more although they may not be able tell you the reasons. Just do your best for the project and assume everyone else is doing their best too, although their best may be lower than yours.</li>

                  <p>We have chosen a basic set of tools after considering ease of learning, availability, typical-ness, popularity, migration path to other tools, etc. There are many reasons for limiting your choices:</p>
                  <p>Pedagogical reasons:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sometimes 'good enough', not necessarily the best, tools are a better fit for beginners</strong>: Most bleeding edge, most specialized, or most sophisticated tools are not suitable for a beginner course. After mastering our toolset, you will find it easy to upgrade to such high-end tools by yourself. We do expect you to eventually (after this module) migrate to better tools and, having learned more than one tool, to attain a more general understanding about a family of tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>We want you to learn to thrive under given conditions</strong>: As a professional Software Engineer, you must learn to be productive in any given tool environment, rather than insist on using your preferred tools. It is usually in small companies doing less important work that you get to chose your own toolset. Bigger companies working on mature products often impose some choices on developers, such as the project management tool, code repository, IDE, language etc. For example, Google used SVN as their revision control software until very recently, long after SVN fell out of popularity among developers. Sometimes this is due to cost reasons (tool licensing cost), and sometimes due to legacy reasons (because the tool is already entrenched in their code base).<br>
                      While programming in school is often a solo sport, programming in the industry is a team sport. As we are training you to become professional software engineers, it is important to get over the psychological hurdle of needing to satisfy individual preferences and get used to making the best of a given environment.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Practical reasons:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Some of the topics are tightly coupled to tools. Allowing more tools means tutors need to learn more tools, which increases their workload.</li>
                    <li>We provide learning resources for tools. e.g. 'Git guides'. Allowing more tools means we need to produce more resources.</li>
                    <li>When all students use the same tool, the collective expertise of the tool is more, increasing the opportunities for you to learn from each others.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Meanwhile, feel free to share with peers your experience of using other tools.</p>

          <p><strong>Come prepared for the tutorial</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>This week's tutorial involves discussing some theory questions. There are 6 questions (listed under Tutorial 8 in the <a href="https://nus-cs2103-AY1819S2.github.io/cs2103-website">schedule page</a>. <strong>Please divide the questions among yourselves and come prepared to answer them during the tutorial.</strong> We will not be able to finish all five questions during the tutorial unless you come prepared.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Feedback for peers, teaching team</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Project</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>You are expected to start proper project planning and tracking after v1.1</strong>. We have refined instructions for <a href="https://nus-cs2103-AY1819S2.github.io/cs2103-website/admin/project-w08-mid-v12.html">mid-v1.2 instructions</a> (updated last Friday). Please follow carefully.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Try to achieve all milestone requirements, but do not fret if you miss a few</strong>. You will get full marks as long as you achieve about 60% of the milestone requirements on average. Yes, that's a pretty low bar, but we have set it low in order to reduce workload and stress. Ideally, you should achieve close to 80-90%.</p>

                        <div>
                          <p>Consider two classes, <code>Account</code> and <code>Guarantor</code>, with an association as shown in the following diagram:</p>
                          <tip-box>
                            <p>Example:</p>
                            <img src="/cs2103-website/book/errorHandling/defensiveProgramming/compulsoryAssociations/images/accountGuarantor.png" height="50">
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Here, the association is compulsory i.e. an <code>Account</code> object should always be linked to a <code>Guarantor</code>. One way to implement this is to simply use a reference variable, like this:</p>
                            <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Account</span> </span>{
    Guarantor guarantor;

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">setGuarantor</span><span class="hljs-params">(Guarantor g)</span> </span>{
        guarantor = g;
    }
}
</code></pre>
                            <p>However, what if someone else used the <code>Account</code> class like this?</p>
                            <pre><code class="hljs java">Account a = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Account();
a.setGuarantor(<span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>);
</code></pre>
                            <p>This results in an <code>Account</code> without a <code>Guarantor</code>! In a real banking system, this could have serious consequences! The code here did not try to prevent such a thing from happening. We can make the code more defensive by proactively enforcing the multiplicity constraint, like this:</p>
                            <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Account</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> Guarantor guarantor;

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title">Account</span><span class="hljs-params">(Guarantor g)</span></span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (g == <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>) {
            stopSystemWithMessage(<span class="hljs-string">"multiplicity violated. Null Guarantor"</span>);
        }
        guarantor = g;
    }
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">setGuarantor</span> <span class="hljs-params">(Guarantor g)</span></span>{

                              <tooltip content="term was coined by Bertrand Meyer">Design by contract (DbC)</tooltip> is an approach for designing software that requires defining formal, precise and verifiable interface specifications for software components.
                            </strong></p>
                          <p>Suppose an operation is implemented with the behavior specified precisely in the API (preconditions, post conditions, exceptions etc.). When following the defensive approach, the code should first check if the preconditions have been met. Typically, exceptions are thrown if preconditions are violated. In contrast, the <em>Design-by-Contract (DbC)</em> approach to coding assumes that it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure all preconditions are met. The operation will honor the contract only if the preconditions have been met. If any of them have not been met, the behavior of the operation is &quot;unspecified&quot;.</p>
                          <p>Languages such as Eiffel have native support for DbC. For example, preconditions of an operation can be specified in Eiffel and the language runtime will check precondition violations without the need to do it explicitly in the code. To follow the DbC approach in languages such as Java and C++ where there is no built-in DbC support, assertions can be used to confirm pre-conditions.</p>

                          <p>Here are some tips on writing effective documentation.</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Use plenty of diagrams</strong>: It is not enough to explain something in words; complement it with visual illustrations (e.g. a UML diagram).</li>
                            <li><strong>Use plenty of examples</strong>: When explaining algorithms, show a running example to illustrate each step of the algorithm, in parallel to worded explanations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use simple and direct explanations</strong>: Convoluted explanations and fancy words will annoy readers. Avoid long sentences.</li>
                            <li><strong>Get rid of statements that do not add value</strong>: For example, 'We made sure our system works perfectly' (who didn't?), 'Component X has its own responsibilities' (of course it has!).</li>
                            <li><strong>It is not a good idea to have separate sections for each type of artifact</strong>, such as 'use cases', 'sequence diagrams', 'activity diagrams', etc. Such a structure, coupled with the indiscriminate inclusion of diagrams without justifying their need, indicates a failure to understand the purpose of documentation. Include diagrams when they are needed to explain something. If you want to provide additional diagrams for completeness' sake, include them in the appendix as a reference.</li>

                                      <p>(a) Use diagrams when they help to understand the text descriptions. Text and diagrams should be used in tandem. Having separate sections for each diagram type is a sign of generating diagrams for the sake of having them.</p>
                                      <p>(b) Both are important, but lengthy, complete, accurate yet hard to understand documents are not that useful.</p>

                              <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity we are interested in, and suppressing the more complex details below that level.</p>

                          <p><strong>The guiding principle of abstraction is that only details that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand needs to be considered.</strong> As most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details, it is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. That is where abstraction can help.</p>
                          <p><strong>Ignoring lower level data items and thinking in terms of bigger entities is called <mark><em>data abstraction</em></mark>.</strong></p>

                            <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Within a certain software component, we might deal with a <em>user</em> data type, while ignoring the details contained in the user data item such as <em>name</em>, and <em>date of birth</em>.

                            <li><strong>Subclass coupling</strong>: a class inherits from another class. Note that a child class is coupled to the parent class but not the other way around.</li>

                                      <p>Version 2 is less cohesive.</p>
                                      <p>Explanation: Version 2 is handling functionality related to login, which is not directly related to the concept of ‘email message’ that the class is supposed to represent. On a related note, we can improve the cohesion of both versions by removing the sendMessage functionality. Although sending message is related to emails, this class is supposed to represent an email message, not an email server.</p>

                              <p><strong>Open-Closed Principle (OCP)</strong>: A module should be <em>open</em> for extension but <em>closed</em> for modification. That is, modules should be written so that they can be extended, without requiring them to be modified. <sub>-- proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Meyer">Bertrand Meyer</a></sub></p>

                          <p>In object-oriented programming, OCP can be achieved in various ways. This often requires separating the <em>specification (i.e. interface)</em> of a module from its <em>implementation</em>.</p>

                            <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> In the design given below, the behavior of the <code>CommandQueue</code> class can be altered by adding more concrete <code>Command</code> subclasses. For example, by including a <code>Delete</code> class alongside <code>List</code>, <code>Sort</code>, and <code>Reset</code>, the <code>CommandQueue</code> can now perform delete commands without modifying its code at all. That is, its behavior was extended without having to modify its code. Hence, it was open to extensions, but closed to modification.</p>

                                    <ul class="task-list">
                                      <li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> a. A software design should promote separation of concerns in a design.</li>

                                      <li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> c. A software design should follow single responsibility principle.</li>

                                      <p>(a)(b)(c)</p>
                                      <p>Explanation: By making ‘user interaction’ GUI class’ sole responsibility, we increase its cohesion. This is also in line with separation of concerns (i.e., we separated the concern of user interaction) and single responsibility principle (GUI class has only one responsibility).</p>

                    <p>There is no explicit penalty for switching to a lower level AB. All projects are evaluated based on the same yardstick irrespective of on which AB it is based. As an AB is given to you as a 'free' head-start, a lower level AB gives you a shorter head-start, which means your final product is likely to be less functional than those from teams using AB-4 unless you progress faster than them. Nevertheless, you should switch to AB2/3 if you feel you can learn more from the project that way, as our goal is to maximize learning, not features.<br>
                      If your team wants to stay with AB-4 but you want to switch to a lower level AB, let the us know so that we can work something out for you.</p>
                    <p>If you have opted to use AB-2 or AB-3 instead of AB-4 as the basis of your product, please note the following points:</p>

For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></li>

                                          <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                                          <ol>
                                            <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                                            <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                                            <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                                            <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                                            <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                                            <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                                            <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>

                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Reduce automated tests</strong> have benefits, but they can be a pain to write/maintain; GUI tests are especially hard to maintain because their behavior can sometimes depend on things such as the OS, resolution etc.<br>
                          It is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated tests you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much.<br>
                          There is no direct penalty for removing GUI tests. Also note <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:appEworkflow-testingExpectations">our expectation on test code</trigger>.</p>

                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Reduce automated checks</strong>: You can also reduce the rigor of checkstyle checks to expedite PR processing.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Switch to a lighter workflow</strong>: While <em>forking workflow</em> is the safest, it is also rather heavy. You an switch to a simpler workflow if the forking workflow is slowing you down. Refer the textbook to find more about alternative workflows: <em>branching workflow</em>, <em>centralized workflow</em>. However, we still recommend that you use PR reviews, at least for PRs affecting others' features.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>You can also increase the rigor/safety of your workflow</strong> in the following ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Use GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/"><em>Protected Branches</em></a> feature to protect your <code>master</code> branch against rogue PRs.</li>

                          <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
                          <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>

                    <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current status of the project. You can also use GitHub's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>

                      <p>There is no explicit penalty for switching to a lower level AB. All projects are evaluated based on the same yardstick irrespective of on which AB it is based. As an AB is given to you as a 'free' head-start, a lower level AB gives you a shorter head-start, which means your final product is likely to be less functional than those from teams using AB-4 unless you progress faster than them. Nevertheless, you should switch to AB2/3 if you feel you can learn more from the project that way, as our goal is to maximize learning, not features.<br>
                        If your team wants to stay with AB-4 but you want to switch to a lower level AB, let the us know so that we can work something out for you.</p>
                      <p>If you have opted to use AB-2 or AB-3 instead of AB-4 as the basis of your product, please note the following points:</p>
                      <ul>

For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></li>

                                          It is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated tests you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much.<br>
                                          There is no direct penalty for removing GUI tests. Also note <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:appEworkflow-testingExpectations">our expectation on test code</trigger>.</p>

You an switch to a simpler workflow if the forking workflow is slowing you down.

                                            <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                                            <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                                            <ol>
                                              <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                                              <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                                              <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                                              <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                                              <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                                              <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                                              <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>
                                            </ol>

                          <p><strong>Reduce automated tests</strong> have benefits, but they can be a pain to write/maintain; GUI tests are especially hard to maintain because their behavior can sometimes depend on things such as the OS, resolution etc.<br>
                            It is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated tests you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much.<br>
                            There is no direct penalty for removing GUI tests. Also note <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:appEworkflow-testingExpectations">our expectation on test code</trigger>.</p>

                          <p><strong>Reduce automated checks</strong>: You can also reduce the rigor of checkstyle checks to expedite PR processing.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong>Switch to a lighter workflow</strong>: While <em>forking workflow</em> is the safest, it is also rather heavy. You an switch to a simpler workflow if the forking workflow is slowing you down. Refer the textbook to find more about alternative workflows: <em>branching workflow</em>, <em>centralized workflow</em>. However, we still recommend that you use PR reviews, at least for PRs affecting others' features.</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Use GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/"><em>Protected Branches</em></a> feature to protect your <code>master</code> branch against rogue PRs.</li>

                            <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
                            <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>

Also make sure those issues are assigned to team members. <span class="dimmed">Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</span></p>
                          </li>

                              or a <strong>product <em>release</em> done on GitHub</strong>. A product release is optional for v1.2 but required from from v1.3. Click <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/releases/">here</a> to see an example release.</p>
