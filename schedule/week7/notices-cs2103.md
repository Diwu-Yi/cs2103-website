* The [Project List Page]({{ module_website }}/admin/projectList.html) will be up this week.

**If your photo or your UI mock-up does not appear in the page**, you have not followed our instructions correctly. 'Close enough' is sometimes not 'good enough'. Please rectify before v1.1 deadline. In particular,
  * Please **follow our guidelines for your photo**. If not, the photo will not serve its intended purpose (i.e., for others to identify you).
  * Please **limit the `Ui.png` to one screenshot only**, so that your UI mockup takes roughly the same amount of space as other teams' in the Teams Page.


* **Peer Evaluation Round 1** will open on TEAMMATES. You will receive the submission link soon. **If you do not submit feedback responses, you will forfeit participation marks that you earned based on feedback ratings received from others**.

* **An anonymous survey to submit feedback about the teaching team** is now open on LumiNUS. Please take a few minutes to give feedback to your tutors. As usual, you can use the 'anonymous feedback' feature of LumiNUS to send us feedback any time.


**v1.1 milestone deadline is coming up soon**: Refer to v1.1 instructions carefully and try to follow as closely as you can. However, there is no lower bar on the code changes you need to do. Even a tiny change is acceptable. Use that flexibility to control your workload.
