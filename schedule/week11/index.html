These stages are collectively known as the <em>software development life cycle</em> (SDLC).</strong> There are several approaches, known as <em>software development life cycle models</em> (also called <em>software process models</em>) that describe different ways to go through the SDLC. Each process model prescribes a &quot;roadmap&quot; for the software developers to manage the development effort. The roadmap describes the aims of the development stage(s), the artifacts or outcome of each stage as well as the workflow i.e. the relationship between stages.</p>

The name <em>waterfall</em> stems from how the model is drawn to look like a waterfall (see below).</p>

                          <p><strong>When one stage of the process is completed, it should produce some artifacts to be used in the next stage.</strong> For example, upon completion of the requirement stage a comprehensive list of requirements is produced that will see no further modifications. A strict application of the sequential model would require each stage to be completed before starting the next.</p>
                          <p><strong>This could be a useful model when the problem statement that is well-understood and stable.</strong> In such cases, using the sequential model should result in a timely and systematic development effort, provided that all goes well. As each stage has a well-defined outcome, the progress of the project can be tracked with a relative ease.</p>
                          <p><strong>The major problem with this model is that requirements of a real-world project are rarely well-understood at the beginning and keep changing over time.</strong> One reason for this is that users are generally not aware of how a software application can be used without prior experience in using a similar application.</p>

                          <p><strong>The iterative model (sometimes called <em>iterative</em> and <em>incremental</em>) advocates having several <em>iterations</em> of SDLC.</strong> Each of the iterations could potentially go through all the development stages, from requirement gathering to testing &amp; deployment. Roughly, it appears to be similar to several cycles of the sequential model.</p>

                          <p></p>
                          <p><strong>In this model, each of the iterations produces a new version of the product.</strong> Feedback on the version can then be fed to the next iteration. Taking the Minesweeper game as an example, the iterative model will deliver a fully playable version from the early iterations. However, the first iteration will have primitive functionality, for example, a clumsy text based UI, fixed board size, limited randomization etc. These functionalities will then be improved in later releases.</p>
                          <p><strong>The iterative model can take a <em>breadth-first</em> or a <em>depth-first</em> approach to iteration planning.</strong></p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>breadth-first</strong>: an iteration evolves all major components in parallel.</li>
                            <li><strong>depth-first</strong>: an iteration focuses on fleshing out only some components.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p><strong>Most project use a mixture of breadth-first and depth-first iterations.</strong> Hence, the common phrase ‘an iterative and incremental process’.</p>

                        <div>
                          <p>In 2001, a group of prominent software engineering practitioners met and brainstormed for an alternative to documentation-driven, heavyweight software development processes that were used in most large projects at the time. This resulted in something called the <em>agile manifesto</em> (a vision statement of what they were looking to do).</p>
                          <blockquote>
                            <p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
                            <p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</li>
                              <li><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</li>
                              <li><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</li>
                              <li><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.<br>
                              <sub>Extract from the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a></sub></p>
                          </blockquote>
                          <p>Subsequently, some of the signatories of the manifesto went on to create process models that try to follow it. These processes are collectively called agile processes. Some of the key features of agile approaches are:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Requirements are prioritized based on the needs of the user, are clarified regularly (at times almost on a daily basis) with the entire project team, and are factored into the development schedule as appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Instead of doing a very elaborate and detailed design and a project plan for the whole project, the team works based on a rough project plan and a high level design that evolves as the project goes on.</li>
                            <li>Strong emphasis on complete transparency and responsibility sharing among the team members. The team is responsible together for the delivery of the product. Team members are accountable, and regularly and openly share progress with each other and with the user.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p><strong>There are a number of agile processes in the development world today. <em>eXtreme Programming (XP)</em> and <em>Scrum</em> are two of the well-known ones.</strong></p>

                          <p>This description of Scrum was adapted from Wikipedia [retrieved on 18/10/2011], emphasis added:</p>
                          <tip-box>
                            <p><strong>Scrum is a process skeleton that contains sets of practices and predefined roles. The main roles in Scrum are:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><strong>The Scrum Master</strong>, who maintains the processes (typically in lieu of a project manager)</li>
                              <li><strong>The Product Owner</strong>, who represents the stakeholders and the business</li>
                              <li><strong>The Team</strong>, a cross-functional group who do the actual analysis, design, implementation, testing, etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>A Scrum project is divided into iterations called Sprints.</strong> A sprint is the basic unit of development in Scrum. Sprints tend to last between one week and one month, and are a timeboxed (i.e. restricted to a specific duration) effort of a constant length.</p>
                            <p><strong>Each sprint is preceded by a planning meeting</strong>, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made, and followed by a review or retrospective meeting, where the progress is reviewed and lessons for the next sprint are identified.</p>
                            <p><strong>During each sprint, the team creates a potentially deliverable product increment</strong> (for example, working and tested software). The set of features that go into a sprint come from the product backlog, which is a prioritized set of high level requirements of work to be done. Which backlog items go into the sprint is determined during the sprint planning meeting. During this meeting, the Product Owner informs the team of the items in the product backlog that he or she wants completed. The team then determines how much of this they can commit to complete during the next sprint, and records this in the sprint backlog. During a sprint, no one is allowed to change the sprint backlog, which means that the requirements are frozen for that sprint. Development is timeboxed such that the sprint must end on time; if requirements are not completed for any reason they are left out and returned to the product backlog. After a sprint is completed, the team demonstrates the use of the software.</p>
                            <p><strong>Scrum enables the creation of self-organizing teams by encouraging co-location of all team members</strong>, and verbal communication between all team members and disciplines in the project.</p>
                            <p><strong>A key principle of Scrum is its recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need</strong> (often called requirements churn), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner. As such, Scrum adopts an empirical approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team’s ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging requirements.</p>

                          <p><strong><em>Daily Scrum</em> is another key scrum practice</strong>. The description below was adapted from <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/daily-scrum">https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com</a> (emphasis added):</p>
                          <tip-box>
                            <p><strong>In Scrum, on each day of a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum meeting called the &quot;daily scrum.”</strong> Meetings are typically held in the same location and at the same time each day. Ideally, a daily scrum meeting is held in the morning, as it helps set the context for the coming day's work. These scrum meetings are strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes. This keeps the discussion brisk but relevant.</p>
                            <p>...</p>
                            <p><strong>During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>What did you do yesterday?</li>
                              <li>What will you do today?</li>
                              <li>Are there any impediments in your way?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>...</p>
                            <p>The daily scrum meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. <strong>Issues that are raised are taken offline and usually dealt with by the relevant subgroup immediately after the meeting.</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>Extreme Programming (XP) stresses customer satisfaction.</strong> Instead of delivering everything you could possibly want on some date far in the future, this process delivers the software you need as you need it.</p>
                            <p><strong>XP aims to empower developers to confidently respond to changing customer requirements</strong>, even late in the life cycle.</p>
                            <p><strong>XP emphasizes teamwork.</strong> Managers, customers, and developers are all equal partners in a collaborative team. XP implements a simple, yet effective environment enabling teams to become highly productive. The team self-organizes around the problem to solve it as efficiently as possible.</p>
                            <p><strong>XP aims to improve a software project in five essential ways: communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage.</strong> Extreme Programmers constantly communicate with their customers and fellow programmers. They keep their design simple and clean. They get feedback by testing their software starting on day one. Every small success deepens their respect for the unique contributions of each and every team member. With this foundation, Extreme Programmers are able to courageously respond to changing requirements and technology.</p>
                            <p><strong>XP has a set of simple rules.</strong> XP is a lot like a jig saw puzzle with many small pieces. Individually the pieces make no sense, but when combined together a complete picture can be seen. This flow chart shows how Extreme Programming's rules work together.</p>

                          <p>Given above is a visualization of a project done using the Unified process (source: Wikipedia). As the diagram shows, a phase can consist of several iterations. Each vertical column (labeled “I1” “E1”, “E2”, “C1”, etc.) represents a single iteration. Each of the iterations consists of a set of ‘workflows’ such as ‘Business modeling’, ‘Requirements’, ‘Analysis &amp; Design’ etc. The shaded region indicates the amount of resource and effort spent on a particular workflow in a particular iteration.</p>
                          <p><strong>Unified process is a flexible and customizable process model framework rather than a single fixed process.</strong> For example, the number of iterations in each phase, definition of workflows, and the intensity of a given workflow in a given iteration can be adjusted according to the nature of the project. Take the Construction Phase, to develop a simple system, one or two iterations would be sufficient. For a more complicated system, multiple iterations will be more helpful. Therefore, the diagram above simply records a particular application of the UP rather than prescribe how the UP is to be applied. However, this record can be refined and reused for similar future projects.</p>

                                        <li>Iterative: Frequent reworking can deteriorate the design. Frequent refactoring should be used to prevent this. Frequent customer feedback can help to improve the quality (i.e. quality as seen by the customer).</li>
                                        <li>Sequential: Final quality depends on the quality of each phase. Any quality problem in any phase could result in a low quality product.</li>

However, this does not guarantee that all features promised at the beginning will be delivered under the estimated cost. (The sequential model requires us to carry on even if the budget is exceeded because there is no intermediate version to fall back on).</li>

                                      <p>Iterative reworking of existing artifacts could add to the cost. However, this is “cheaper” than finding at the end that we built the wrong product.</p>

                                        <li>Sequential: Customer satisfaction is guaranteed only if the product was delivered as promised and if the initial requirements proved to be accurate. However, the customer is not required to do the extra work of giving frequent feedback during the project.</li>

                                        <li>It could produce better quality code.</li>

                                      <p>(c) Arguments in favor of TDD:</p>
                                      <ul>
                                        <li>Testing will not be neglected due to time pressure (because it is done first).</li>
                                        <li>Forces the developer to think about what the component should be before jumping into implementing it.</li>
                                        <li>Optimizes programmer effort (i.e. if all tests pass, there is no need to add any more functionality).</li>
                                        <li>Forces us to automate all tests.</li>

                                      <p>Arguments against TDD (not necessarily true):</p>
                                      <ul>
                                        <li>Since tests can be seen as ‘executable specifications’, programmers tend to neglect others forms of documentation.</li>
                                        <li>Promotes ‘trial-and-error’ coding instead of making programmers think through their algorithms (i.e. ‘just keep hacking until all tests pass’).</li>
                                        <li>Gives a false sense of security. (what if you forgot to test certain scenarios?)</li>
                                      </ul>
                                      <p>Not intuitive. Some programmer might resist adopting TDD.</p>

                          <p>While you may be tempted to use many libraries/frameworks/platform that seem to crop up on a regular basis and promise to bring great benefits, note that <strong>there are costs associated with reuse</strong>. Here are some:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>The reused code <strong>may be an overkill</strong> (think <em>using a sledgehammer to crack a nut</em>) increasing the size of, or/and degrading the performance of, your software.</li>
                            <li>The reused software <strong>may not be mature/stable enough</strong> to be used in an important product. That means the software can change drastically and rapidly, possibly in ways that break your software.</li>
                            <li>Non-mature software has the <strong>risk of dying off</strong> as fast as they emerged, leaving you with a dependency that is no longer maintained.</li>
                            <li>The license of the reused software (or its dependencies) <strong>restrict how you can use/develop your software</strong>.</li>
                            <li>The reused software <strong>might have bugs, missing features, or security vulnerabilities</strong> that are important to your product but not so important to the maintainers of that software, which means those flaws will not get fixed as fast as you need them to.</li>
                            <li><strong>Malicious code can sneak into your product</strong> via compromised dependencies.</li>
                          </ul>

                                      <p>Pros</p>
                                      <ul>
                                        <li>The potential to create a much better product by reusing the framework.</li>
                                        <li>Learning a new framework is good for the future job prospects.</li>

                                      <ul>
                                        <li>Learning curve may be steep.</li>
                                        <li>May not be stable (it was recently released).</li>
                                        <li>May not allow us to do exactly what we want. While frameworks allow customization, such customization can be limited.</li>
                                        <li>Performance penalties.</li>
                                        <li>Might interfere with learning objectives of the module.</li>
                                      </ul>
                                      <p>Note that having more cons does not mean we should not use this framework. Further investigation is required before we can make a final decision.</p>

One of them is the ‘inversion of control’ used by frameworks but not libraries. Furthermore, frameworks do not have to be bigger than libraries all the time.</p>

The author of code below yours can add the GitHub username to the empty tag later.
                                Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>

                        <li>The primary objective of the PE is to <mark>increase the rigor of project assessment</mark>. Assessing most aspects of the project involves an element subjectivity. As the project counts for 50% of the final grade, it is not prudent to rely on evaluations of tutors alone as there can be significant variations between how different tutors assess projects. That is why we collect more data points via the PE so as to minimize the chance of your project being affected by evaluator-bias.</li>
                        <li>Note that <mark>none of the significant project grade components are calculated solely based on peer ratings</mark>. Rather, PE data are mostly used to cross-validate tutor assessments and identify cases that need further investigation. When peer inputs are used for grading, usually they are combined with tutor evaluations with appropriate weight for each. In some cases ratings from team members are given a higher weight compared to ratings from other teams, if that is appropriate.</li>
                        <li>As a bonus, PE also gives us an opportunity to evaluate your manual testing skills, product evaluation skills, effort estimation skills etc.</li>
                        <li>Note that the PE is not a means of <em>pitting you against each other</em>. Developers and testers play for the same side; they need to push each other to improve the quality of their work -- not bring down each other.</li>

                      <p>There will be a review period for you to respond to the <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/pe-results/issues">bug reports</a> you received.</p>
                      <p>Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE (exact time to be announced) and will last until the following <strong>Wednesday midnight</strong>. However, you are recommended to finish this task ASAP, to minimize cutting into your exam preparation work.</p>
                      <p>Bug reviewing is recommended to be done as a team as some of the decisions need team consensus.</p>

                            <p><strong>First, don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.</strong> Many can be duplicates and some can be <em>false positives</em>. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs is not harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</p>

                            <p>You may (but not required to) close the bug report after you are done processing it, as a convenient means of separating the 'processed' issues from 'not yet processed' issues.</p>

                    <li>Taking part in the PE dry run will earn you participation points.</li>
                    <li>There is <mark>no penalty for bugs reported</mark> in your product. Every bug you find is a win-win for you and the team whose product you are testing.</li>

                              If you have more content than the limit given above, you can give a representative samples of UG and DG that showcase your documentation skills. Those samples should be understandable on their own. For the parts left-out, you can give an abbreviated version and refer the reader to the full UG/DG for more details.<br>
                              <span class="dimmed">It's similar to giving extra details as appendices; the reader will look at the UG/DG if the PPP is not enough to make a judgment. For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></li>

                        <ul>
                          <li>The primary objective of the PE is to <mark>increase the rigor of project assessment</mark>. Assessing most aspects of the project involves an element subjectivity. As the project counts for 50% of the final grade, it is not prudent to rely on evaluations of tutors alone as there can be significant variations between how different tutors assess projects. That is why we collect more data points via the PE so as to minimize the chance of your project being affected by evaluator-bias.</li>
                          <li>Note that <mark>none of the significant project grade components are calculated solely based on peer ratings</mark>. Rather, PE data are mostly used to cross-validate tutor assessments and identify cases that need further investigation. When peer inputs are used for grading, usually they are combined with tutor evaluations with appropriate weight for each. In some cases ratings from team members are given a higher weight compared to ratings from other teams, if that is appropriate.</li>
                          <li>As a bonus, PE also gives us an opportunity to evaluate your manual testing skills, product evaluation skills, effort estimation skills etc.</li>
                          <li>Note that the PE is not a means of <em>pitting you against each other</em>. Developers and testers play for the same side; they need to push each other to improve the quality of their work -- not bring down each other.</li>

                        <p>Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE (exact time to be announced) and will last until the following <strong>Wednesday midnight</strong>. However, you are recommended to finish this task ASAP, to minimize cutting into your exam preparation work.</p>

In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs is not harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</p>

                              <li><span class="dimmed">Reason for page limit: These submissions are peer-graded (in the PE) which needs to be done in a limited time span.</span><br>
                                If you have more content than the limit given above, you can give a representative samples of UG and DG that showcase your documentation skills. Those samples should be understandable on their own. For the parts left-out, you can give an abbreviated version and refer the reader to the full UG/DG for more details.<br>
                                <span class="dimmed">It's similar to giving extra details as appendices; the reader will look at the UG/DG if the PPP is not enough to make a judgment. For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></li>

If at all, you can gently explain the rationale for the current behavior but do not waste time getting involved in long arguments. If you think the suggestion/bug is unreasonable, just thank the reporter for their view and close the issue.</li>
