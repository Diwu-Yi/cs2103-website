                  are several approaches, known as <em>software development life cycle models</em> (also called <em>software process models</em>) that describe different ways to go through the SDLC. Each process model prescribes a “roadmap” for the software
                  developers to manage the development effort. The roadmap describes the aims of the development stage(s), the artifacts or outcome of each stage as well as the workflow i.e. the relationship between stages.</p>

                <p>The <em>sequential model</em>, also called the <em>waterfall</em> model, models software development as a linear process, in which the project is seen as progressing steadily in one direction through the development stages. The name <em>waterfall</em>                  stems from how the model is drawn to look like a waterfall (see below).</p><img src="/website/book/processModels/introduction/sequentialModels/images/diagram.png" height="180">
                <p></p>
                <p>When one stage of the process is completed, it should produce some artifacts to be used in the next stage. For example, upon completion of the requirement stage a comprehensive list of requirements is produced that will see no further
                  modifications. A strict application of the sequential model would require each stage to be completed before starting the next.</p>
                <p>This could be a useful model when the problem statement that is well-understood and stable. In such cases, using the sequential model should result in a timely and systematic development effort, provided that all goes well. As each stage
                  has a well-defined outcome, the progress of the project can be tracked with a relative ease.</p>
                <p>The major problem with this model is that requirements of a real-world project are rarely well-understood at the beginning and keep changing over time. One reason for this is that users are generally not aware of how a software application
                  can be used without prior experience in using a similar application.</p>

                <p>The iterative model (sometimes called <em>iterative</em> and <em>incremental</em>) advocates having several <em>iterations</em> of SDLC. Each of the iterations could potentially go through all the development stages, from requirement gathering
                  to testing &amp; deployment. Roughly, it appears to be similar to several cycles of the sequential model.</p><img src="/website/book/processModels/introduction/iterativeModels/images/diagram.png" height="300">
                <p></p>
                <p>In this model, each of the iterations produces a new version of the product. Feedback on the version can then be fed to the next iteration. Taking the Minesweeper game as an example, the iterative model will deliver a fully playable version
                  from the early iterations. However, the first iteration will have primitive functionality, for example, a clumsy text based UI, fixed board size, limited randomization etc. These functionalities will then be improved in later releases.</p>
                <p>The iterative model can take a <em>breadth-first</em> or a <em>depth-first</em> approach to iteration planning.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>breadth-first: an iteration evolves all major components in parallel.</li>
                  <li>depth-first: an iteration focuses on fleshing out only some components.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The breadth-first approach is considered purely ‘iterative’, while depth-first is ‘incremental’. As mentioned before, most project use a mixture of breadth-first and depth-first iterations. Hence, the common phrase ‘an iterative and incremental
                  process’.</p>

                <p>In 2001, a group of prominent software engineering practitioners met and brainstormed for an alternative to documentation-driven, heavyweight software development processes that were used in most large projects at the time. This resulted
                  in something called the <em>agile manifesto</em> (a vision statement of what they were looking to do). The agile manifesto (taken from <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">http://agilemanifesto.org/</a>) is given below.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
                  <p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</li>
                    <li><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</li>
                    <li><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>Subsequently, some of the signatories of the manifesto went on to create process models that try to follow it. These processes are collectively called agile processes. Some of the key features of agile approaches are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Requirements are prioritized based on the needs of the user, are clarified regularly (at times almost on a daily basis) with the entire project team, and are factored into the development schedule as appropriate.</li>
                  <li>Instead of doing a very elaborate and detailed design and a project plan for the whole project, the team works based on a rough project plan and a high level design that evolves as the project goes on.</li>
                  <li>Strong emphasis on complete transparency and responsibility sharing among the team members. The team is responsible together for the delivery of the product. Team members are accountable, and regularly and openly share progress with
                    each other and with the user.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are a number of agile processes in the development world today. eXtreme Programming (XP) and Scrum are two of the well-known ones.</p>

                  <p>The analysis process for identifying objects and object classes is recognized as one of the most difficult areas of object-oriented development.</p>
                  <p>--Ian Sommerville, in the book ‘Software Engineering’</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Class diagrams can also be used to model objects in the problem domain (i.e. to model how objects actually interact in the real world, before emulating them in the solution). When used to model the problem domain, such class diagrams are
                  called <em><strong>conceptual class diagrams</strong></em> or <em><strong>OO domain models (OODMs).</strong></em></p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Example: OO domain model of a snakes and ladders game is given below.</p>
                  <p>Description: Snakes and ladders game is played by two or more players using a board and a die. The board has 100 squares marked 1 to 100. Each player owns one piece. Players take turns to throw the die and advance their piece by the
                    number of squares they earned from the die throw. The board has a number of snakes. If a player’s piece lands on a square with a snake head, the piece is automatically moved to the square containing the snake’s tail. Similarly, a piece
                    can automatically move from a ladder foot to the ladder top. The player whose piece is the first to reach the 100th square wins.</p><img src="/website/book/modeling/modelingStructures/objectOrientedDomainModels/images/diagram.png"
                    height="420">
                  <p></p>
                  <p>The above OO domain model omits the ladder class for simplicity. It can be included in a similar fashion to the Snake class.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p><strong>OODMs do not contain solution-specific classes</strong> (i.e. classes that are used in the solution domain but do not exist in the problem domain). For example, a class called DatabaseConnection could appear in a class diagram
                  but not usually in an OO domain model because DatabaseConnection is something related to a software solution but not an entity in the problem domain.</p>
                <p><strong>OODMs, just like a class diagram, represents the class <em>structure</em> of the problem</strong> domain and not their behavior. To show behavior, use other diagrams such as sequence diagrams.</p>
                <p><strong>OODM notation is similar to class diagram notation but typically omit methods and navigability.</strong></p>

                            <p>Explanation: Both are UML diagrams, and use the class diagram notation. While it is true that often a class diagram may have more classes and more details, the main difference is that the OO domain model describes the problem
                              domain while the class diagram describes the solution.</p>

                <p>Reusability is a major theme in software engineering practices. By reusing tried-and-tested components, the robustness of a new software system can be enhanced while reducing the manpower and time requirement. Reusable components come
                  in many forms; it can be reusing a piece of code, a subsystem, or a whole software.</p>

                <p>The overall structure and execution flow of a specific category of software systems can be very similar. The similarity is an opportunity to reuse at a high scale.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Running example:</p>
                  <p>IDEs for different programming languages are similar in how they support editing code, organizing project files, debugging, etc.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>A <em>software framework</em> is a reusable implementation of a software (or part thereof) providing <em>generic</em> functionality that can be selectively customized to produce a <em>specific</em> application.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Running example:</p>
                  <p>Eclipse is an IDE framework that can be used to create IDEs for different programming languages.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>Some frameworks provide a complete implementation of a <em>default</em> behavior which makes them immediately usable.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Running example:</p>
                  <p>Eclipse is a fully functional Java IDE out-of-the-box.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>A framework facilitates the adaptation and customization of some desired functionality.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Running example:</p>
                  <p>Eclipse plugin system can be used to create an IDE for different programming languages while reusing most of the existing IDE features of Eclipse. E.g. <a href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pydev-python-ide-eclipse">https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pydev-python-ide-eclipse</a></p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>Some frameworks cover only a specific components or an aspect.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Example:</p>
                  <p>JavaFx a framework for creating Java GUIs.</p>

                <p>A <em>platform</em> provides a runtime environment for applications. A platform is often bundled with various libraries, tools, frameworks, and technologies in addition to a runtime environment but the defining characteristic of a software
                  platform is the presence of a runtime environment.</p>
                <p>Technically, an operating system can be called a platform. For example, Windows PC is a platform for desktop applications while iOS is a platform for mobile apps.</p>
                <p>Two well-known examples of platforms are JavaEE and .NET, both of which sit above Operating systems layer, and are used to develop <em>enterprise applications</em>. Infrastructure services such as connection pooling, load balancing, remote

                <tip-box>
                  Scrum is a process skeleton that contains sets of practices and predefined roles. The main roles in Scrum are:
                  <ul>
                    <li>The ScrumMaster, who maintains the processes (typically in lieu of a project manager)</li>
                    <li>The Product Owner, who represents the stakeholders and the business</li>
                    <li>The Team, a cross-functional group who do the actual analysis, design, implementation, testing, etc.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>A Scrum project is divided into iterations called Sprints. A sprint is the basic unit of development in Scrum. Sprints tend to last between one week and one month, and are a timeboxed (i.e. restricted to a specific duration) effort of
                    a constant length.</p>
                  <p>Each sprint is preceded by a planning meeting, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made, and followed by a review or retrospective meeting, where the progress is reviewed and
                    lessons for the next sprint are identified.</p>
                  <p>During each sprint, the team creates a potentially deliverable product increment (for example, working and tested software). The set of features that go into a sprint come from the product backlog, which is a prioritized set of high
                    level requirements of work to be done. Which backlog items go into the sprint is determined during the sprint planning meeting. During this meeting, the Product Owner informs the team of the items in the product backlog that he or
                    she wants completed. The team then determines how much of this they can commit to complete during the next sprint, and records this in the sprint backlog. During a sprint, no one is allowed to change the sprint backlog, which means
                    that the requirements are frozen for that sprint. Development is timeboxed such that the sprint must end on time; if requirements are not completed for any reason they are left out and returned to the product backlog. After a sprint
                    is completed, the team demonstrates the use of the software.</p>
                  <p>Scrum enables the creation of self-organizing teams by encouraging co-location of all team members, and verbal communication between all team members and disciplines in the project.</p>
                  <p>A key principle of Scrum is its recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need (often called requirements churn), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional
                    predictive or planned manner. As such, Scrum adopts an empirical approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team’s ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging
                    requirements.</p>
                  <p>Like other agile development methodologies, Scrum can be implemented through a wide range of tools. Many companies use universal software tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the sprint backlog. There are
                    also open-source and proprietary software packages dedicated to management of products under the Scrum process. Other organizations implement Scrum without the use of any software tools, and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms
                    such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes. The diagram below illustrates the essence of the Scrum process.</p><img src="/website/book/processModels/exampleProcessModels/scrum/images/diagram.png" height="250">

                <p>The following description was adapted from <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org">http://www.extremeprogramming.org</a>:</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>The first Extreme Programming project was started March 6, 1996. Extreme Programming is one of several popular Agile Processes. Extreme Programming (XP) stresses customer satisfaction. Instead of delivering everything you could possibly
                    want on some date far in the future, this process delivers the software you need as you need it. XP aims to empower developers to confidently respond to changing customer requirements, even late in the life cycle.</p>
                  <p>XP emphasizes teamwork. Managers, customers, and developers are all equal partners in a collaborative team. XP implements a simple, yet effective environment enabling teams to become highly productive. The team self-organizes around
                    the problem to solve it as efficiently as possible.</p>
                  <p>XP aims to improve a software project in five essential ways: communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage. Extreme Programmers constantly communicate with their customers and fellow programmers. They keep their design simple
                    and clean. They get feedback by testing their software starting on day one. Every small success deepens their respect for the unique contributions of each and every team member. With this foundation, Extreme Programmers are able to
                    courageously respond to changing requirements and technology.</p>
                  <p>XP has a set of simple rules. XP is a lot like a jig saw puzzle with many small pieces. Individually the pieces make no sense, but when combined together a complete picture can be seen. This flow chart shows how Extreme Programming's
                    rules work together.</p><img src="/website/book/processModels/exampleProcessModels/xp/images/diagram.png" height="200">

                <p>Given above is a visualization of a project done using the Unified process (source: Wikipedia). As the diagram shows, a phase can consist of several iterations. Each vertical column (labeled “I1” “E1”, “E2”, “C1”, etc.) represents a single
                  iteration. Each of the iterations consists of a set of ‘workflows’ such as ‘Business modeling’, ‘Requirements’, ‘Analysis &amp; Design’ etc. The shaded region indicates the amount of resource and effort spent on a particular workflow
                  in a particular iteration.</p>
                <p>Note that the unified process is a flexible and customizable process model framework rather than a single fixed process. For example, the number of iterations in each phase, definition of workflows, and the intensity of a given workflow
                  in a given iteration can be adjusted according to the nature of the project. Take the Construction Phase, to develope a simple system, one or two iterations would be sufficient. For a more complicated system, multiple iterations will
                  be more helpful. Therefore, the diagram above simply records a particular application of the UP rather than prescribe how the UP is to be applied. However, this record can be refined and reused for similar future projects.</p>

                  <p>CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) is a process improvement approach defined by Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Melon University. CMMI provides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes, which
                    will improve their performance. CMMI-based process improvement includes identifying an organization’s process strengths and weaknesses and making process changes to turn weaknesses into strengths.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>CMMI defines five maturity levels for a process and provides criteria to determine if the process of an organization is at a certain maturity level. The diagram below [taken from Wikipedia] gives an overview of the five levels.</p>

                              <p>Discuss how sequential approach and the iterative approach can affect the following aspects of a project.</p>
                              <p>a) Quality of the final product.</p>
                              <p>b) Risk of overshooting the deadline.</p>
                              <p>c) Total project cost.</p>

                              <p>e) Monitoring the project progress.</p>
                              <p>f) Suitability for a school project</p>
                              <div slot="answer">
                                <p>a) Quality of the final product:</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Iterative: Frequent reworking can deteriorate the design. Frequent refactoring should be used to prevent this. Frequent customer feedback can help to improve the quality (i.e. quality as seen by the customer).</li>
                                  <li>Sequential: Final quality depends on the quality of each phase. Any quality problem in any phase could result in a low quality product.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>b) Risk of overshooting the deadline.</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Iterative: Less risk. If the last iteration got delayed, we can always deliver the previous version. However, this does not guarantee that all features promised at the beginning will be delivered on the deadline.</li>
                                  <li>Sequential: High risk. Any delay in any phase can result in overshooting the deadline with nothing to deliver.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>c) Total project cost.</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Iterative: We can always stop before the project budget is exceeded. However, this does not guarantee that all features promised at the beginning will be delivered under the estimated cost. (The sequential model requires
                                    us to carry on even if the budget is exceeded because there is no intermediate version to fall back on).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Iterative reworking of existing artifacts could add to the cost. However, this is “cheaper” than finding at the end that we built the wrong product.</p>
                                <p>d) Customer satisfaction</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Iterative: Customer gets many opportunities to guide the product in the direction he wants. Customer gets to change requirements even in the middle of the product. Both these can increase the probability of customer satisfaction.</li>
                                  <li>Sequential: Customer satisfaction is guaranteed only if the product was delivered as promised and if the initial requirements proved to be accurate. However, the customer is not required to do the extra work of giving
                                    frequent feedback during the project.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>e) Monitoring project progress</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Iterative: Hard to measure progress against a plan, as the plan itself keeps changing.</li>
                                  <li>Sequential: Easier to measure progress against the plan, although this does not ensure eventual success.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>f) Suitability for a school project:</p>

                                <ul>
                                  <li>Requirements are not fixed.</li>
                                  <li>Overshooting the deadline is not an option.</li>
                                  <li>Gives a chance to learn lessons from one iteration and apply them in the next.</li>

                                  <li>Forces the developer to think about what the component should be before jumping into implementing it.</li>
                                  <li>Optimizes programmer effort (i.e. if all tests pass, there is no need to add any more functionality).</li>

                                  <li>Since tests can be seen as ‘executable specifications’, programmers tend to neglect others forms of documentation.</li>
                                  <li>Promotes ‘trial-and-error’ coding instead of making programmers think through their algorithms (i.e. ‘just keep hacking until all tests pass’).</li>
                                  <li>Gives a false sense of security. (what if you forgot to test certain scenarios?)</li>

                            <p>a) Quality of the final product:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Iterative: Frequent reworking can deteriorate the design. Frequent refactoring should be used to prevent this. Frequent customer feedback can help to improve the quality (i.e. quality as seen by the customer).</li>
                              <li>Sequential: Final quality depends on the quality of each phase. Any quality problem in any phase could result in a low quality product.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>b) Risk of overshooting the deadline.</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Iterative: Less risk. If the last iteration got delayed, we can always deliver the previous version. However, this does not guarantee that all features promised at the beginning will be delivered on the deadline.</li>
                              <li>Sequential: High risk. Any delay in any phase can result in overshooting the deadline with nothing to deliver.</li>

                              <li>Iterative: We can always stop before the project budget is exceeded. However, this does not guarantee that all features promised at the beginning will be delivered under the estimated cost. (The sequential model requires
                                us to carry on even if the budget is exceeded because there is no intermediate version to fall back on).</li>

                            <p>Iterative reworking of existing artifacts could add to the cost. However, this is “cheaper” than finding at the end that we built the wrong product.</p>
                            <p>d) Customer satisfaction</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Iterative: Customer gets many opportunities to guide the product in the direction he wants. Customer gets to change requirements even in the middle of the product. Both these can increase the probability of customer satisfaction.</li>
                              <li>Sequential: Customer satisfaction is guaranteed only if the product was delivered as promised and if the initial requirements proved to be accurate. However, the customer is not required to do the extra work of giving frequent
                                feedback during the project.</li>

                              <li>Iterative: Hard to measure progress against a plan, as the plan itself keeps changing.</li>
                              <li>Sequential: Easier to measure progress against the plan, although this does not ensure eventual success.</li>

                              <li>Since tests can be seen as ‘executable specifications’, programmers tend to neglect others forms of documentation.</li>
                              <li>Promotes ‘trial-and-error’ coding instead of making programmers think through their algorithms (i.e. ‘just keep hacking until all tests pass’).</li>
                              <li>Gives a false sense of security. (what if you forgot to test certain scenarios?)</li>

                          <div slot="answer">

                            </ul>
                            <p>Explanation: An iterative process can meet a deadline better than a sequential process. If the last iteration got delayed, we can always deliver the previous version. However, this does not guarantee that all features promised
                              at the beginning will be delivered on the deadline.</p>

                <p>State Machine Diagrams model state-dependent behavior.</p>
                <p>Consider how a CD player responds when the “eject CD” button is pushed:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>If the CD tray is already open, it does nothing.</li>
                  <li>If the CD tray is already in the process of opening (opened half-way), it continues to open the CD tray.</li>
                  <li>If the CD tray is closed and the CD is being played, it stops playing and opens the CD tray.</li>
                  <li>If the CD tray is closed and CD is not being played, it simply opens the CD tray.</li>
                  <li>If the CD tray is already in the process of closing (closed half-way), it waits until the CD tray is fully closed and opens it immediately afterwards.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>What this means is that the CD player’s response to pushing the “eject CD” button depends on what it was doing at the time of the event. More generally, the CD player’s response to the event received depends on its internal state. Such
                  a behavior is called a <em>state-dependent behavior</em>.</p>
                <p>Often, state-dependent behavior displayed by an object in a system is simple enough that it needs no extra attention; such a behavior can be as simple as a ‘conditional’ behavior like ‘if x&gt;y, then x=x-y’. Occasionally, objects may
                  exhibit state-dependent behavior that is deemed too complex such that it needs to be captured into a separate model. Such state-dependent behavior can be modelled using UML <em>state machine diagrams</em> (SMD for short, sometimes also
                  called ‘state charts’, ‘state diagrams’ or ‘state machines’).</p>
                <p>An SMD views the life-cycle of an object as consisting of a finite number of states where each state displays a unique behavior pattern. An SMD captures information such as the states an object can be in, during its lifetime, and how the
                  object responds to various events while in each state and how the object transits from one state to another. In contrast to sequence diagrams that capture object behavior one scenario at a time, SMDs capture the object’s behavior over
                  its full life cycle. Given below is an example SMD for the Minesweeper game. More details on SMDs can be found in the appendix of this handout.</p>

                <p>Cloud computing can deliver computing services at three levels:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</strong>: IaaS delivers computer infrastructure as a service. For example, a user can deploy virtual servers on the cloud instead of buying physical hardware and installing server software
                      on them. Another example would be a customer using storage space on the cloud for off-site storage of data. Rackspace is an example of an IaaS cloud provider. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is another one.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Platform as a service (PaaS)</strong>: PaaS provides a platform on which developers can build applications. Developers do not have to worry about infrastructure issues such as deploying servers or load balancing as is required
                      when using IaaS. Those aspects are automatically taken care of by the platform. The price to pay is reduced flexibility; applications written on PaaS are limited to facilities provided by the platform. A PaaS example is the Google
                      App Engine where developers can build applications using Java, Python, PHP, or Go whereas Amazon EC2 allows users to deploy application written in any language on their virtual servers.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Software as a service (SaaS)</strong>: This is when applications can be accessed over the network instead of installing them on a local machine. For example, Google Docs is an SaaS word processing software, while Microsoft
                      Word is a traditional word processing software.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>

                        <question>
                          <p>Google Calendar belongs to which category of cloud computing services?s</p>
                          <ul class="task-list">
                            <li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> a. IaaS</li>
                            <li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> b. PaaS</li>
                            <li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> c. SaaS</li>
                          </ul>
                          <div slot="answer">
                            <ul class="task-list">
                              <li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> a. IaaS</li>
                              <li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> b. PaaS</li>
                              <li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" checked type="checkbox"> c. SaaS</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Explanation: It is a <em>software</em> as a service. Instead of installing a calendar software on your desktop, we can use the Google Calendar software that lives ‘on the cloud’.</p>
