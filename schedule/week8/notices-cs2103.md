**Come prepared for the tutorial**:

* This week's tutorial involves discussing some theory questions. There are 6 questions (listed under Tutorial 8 in the [schedule page]({{ module_website }}). **Please divide the questions among yourselves and come prepared to answer them during the tutorial.** We will not be able to finish all five questions during the tutorial unless you come prepared.


**Feedback for peers, teaching team**


**Project**

* **You are expected to start proper project planning and tracking after v1.1**. We have refined instructions for [mid-v1.2 instructions]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-w08-mid-v12.html) (updated last Friday). Please follow carefully.

* **Try to achieve all milestone requirements, but do not fret if you miss a few**.  You will get full marks as long as you achieve about 60% of the milestone requirements on average. Yes, that's a pretty low bar, but we have set it low in order to reduce workload and stress. Ideally, you should achieve close to 80-90%.
