Use tests from AddressBook-Level4 to illustrate the difference between unit testings and integration testing. Hint: good examples [`seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManagerTest.java),[`seedu.address.logic.commands.AddCommandTest`](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddCommandTest.java),[`seedu.address.logic.commands.AddCommandIntegrationTest`](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddCommandIntegrationTest.java)
