<tip-box type="important"> 
 
 There are no tutorials this week due to CNY. <br>
 
</tip-box>
 


* Get started on the project (i.e., defining your project direction and requirements). **Try to do at least step 1 of [mid-v1.0 project milestone]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-w04-mid-v10.html)** before coming to the tutorial this week, and try to finish the remainder by the end of this week.

* A heads up: **next week is going to be HEAVY** ðŸ˜¨ as it has two graded tasks -- both require significant team efforts and a substantial time period to complete. We urge you all to **make full use of this week to prepare yourself for that challenge**. In particular,
  * Try to reach [mid-v1.0]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-w04-mid-v10.html) fully i.e., complete all 3 steps.
  * If you are not familiar with Git and GitHub, review and complete the exercises from previous current week. 
 
* **One part of this week's lecture is not covered in the textbook** and is relevant for your project work for the upcoming project milestone v1.0. You are encouraged to attend this week's lecture even if you don't normally come to lectures.
