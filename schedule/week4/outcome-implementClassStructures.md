**Acceptable**: Some OOP code you have written in which there are more than 10 classes.

**Suggested**: Do the exercise in [[addressbook-level2: LO-ImplementClasses]({{module_org}}/addressbook-level2/blob/master/doc/LearningOutcomes.md#implement-a-class-lo-implementclass)]. Update I/O tests (i.e. `expected.txt` etc.) and the User Guide (if applicable) but you may ignore JUnit tests (we have not covered that topic yet).
