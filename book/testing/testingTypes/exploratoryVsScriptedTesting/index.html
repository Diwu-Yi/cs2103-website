              <p><strong>Here are two alternative approaches to testing a software: <em>Scripted</em> testing and <em>Exploratory</em> testing</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Scripted testing:</strong> First write a set of test cases based on the expected behavior of the SUT, and then perform testing based on that set of test cases.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Exploratory testing:</strong> Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Exploratory testing is ‚Äòthe simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution‚Äô
                <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em>                because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester‚Äôs past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations
                where more faults are found.</p>
              <tip-box>
                <p>üì¶ Here is an example thought process behind a segment of an exploratory testing session:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>‚ÄúHmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; we need to look at them soon. But before that, let us give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature
                    y works, even if x doesn‚Äôt work. Now, if feature y doesn‚Äôt work 100%, we have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...‚Äù</p>
                </blockquote>
              </tip-box>
              <tip-box>
                <p>üí° <strong>Exploratory testing is also known as <em>reactive testing, error guessing technique, attack-based testing,</em> and <em>bug hunting</em>.</strong></p>

              <p>Which approach is better ‚Äì <strong>scripted or exploratory? A mix is better.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The success of exploratory testing depends on the tester‚Äôs prior experience and intuition.</strong> Exploratory testing should be done by experienced testers, using a clear strategy/plan/framework. Ad-hoc exploratory testing by unskilled
                or inexperienced testers without a clear strategy is not recommended for real-world non-trivial systems. While <strong>exploratory testing may allow us to detect some problems in a relatively short time, it is not prudent to use exploratory testing as the sole means of testing a critical system</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>Scripted testing is more systematic, and hence, likely to discover more bugs given sufficient time</strong>, while exploratory testing would aid in quick error discovery, especially if the tester has a lot of experience in testing
                similar systems.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>In some contexts, you will achieve your testing mission better through a more scripted approach; in other contexts, your mission will benefit more from the ability to create and improve tests as you execute them. I find that most situations
                  benefit from a mix of scripted and exploratory approaches. --
