## Project â†’ mid-v1.3 [week 10]
</div>
<div id="body">

Given below are some recommended progress for you to achieve in the various aspects of the project.

**Project Management:**


* :bulb: Ensure that **each PR that adds an enhancement also updates the relevant parts of documents and tests**. That way, your documentation/testing work will not pile up towards the end.

**Product:**

* :exclamation: Try to **do a <tooltip content="resulting in a jar file on GitHub that can be downloaded by potential users">proper product release</tooltip>** as described in the Developer Guide. You can name it something similar `v1.25`. Reason: You are _required_ to do a proper product release for v1.3. Doing a trial at this point will help you iron out any problems in advance.

**Documentation:**

* **User Guide**: Update where the document does not match the current product.
* **Developer Guide**: Similar to User Guide.

**Demo:**

Optional. If you want feedback on your features, you can demo the feature and get feedback from the tutor.
