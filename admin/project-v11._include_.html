  <p><img src="/website/admin/images/v01demo.png" width="125px"><br></p>
  <p><span class="dimmed">[An early version of the mobile phone]</span></p>
  <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Move the product from v1.0 towards v2.0 in a small incremental step.</p>
  <p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each member should add some enhancements that are in line with the vision for v2.0.</li>
    <li>These enhancements should go beyond the component you are in charge of, touching as many other components as possible. Refer to the AddressBook-Level4 Developer Guide has <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s1.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code">some guidance on how to implement a new feature end-to-end</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <tip-box type="important">
    <p><strong>You are required to divide work based on features rather than component</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each team member should implement 1 or more features end-to-end, doing required changes in <em>almost all</em> components. The objective is to force you to learn all components of the software, instead of limiting yourself to your own components.</li>
      <li>You will continue to be in charge of your own components although others will be modifying your components' code. Your role is to help others modify code in your components (you are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about those components) and
        protect your components from degrading. For example, you can review others' changes to your components and suggest possible changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </tip-box>
  <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Demo of the new functionality during the tutorial.</p>
  <p><strong>Grading</strong>: Criteria to consider this milestone as reached</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Minimal ⭐️ : Your enhancement touches components other than the ones you modified in v1.0 and you are able to demo it using your own computer.</li>
    <li>On track ⭐️⭐️ : In addition, you have created a PR for the enhancement, it covers tests and documentation updates for the new feature, and the PR passes Travis checks.</li>
    <li>Ahead ⭐️⭐️⭐️ : Your PR has been reviewed and merged.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="documentation">
  <h3 id="v11-documentation">v1.1 Documentation</h3>
  <p>Update the following pages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Guide</strong>:<br> Update the user guide to describe what the product would be like when it is at 2.0. Mark features not implemented yet as <code>Coming in v2.0</code>. You may use UI mockups where necessary.</li>
  </ul>
  <tip-box type="tip">
    <p>It is highly recommended that you <strong>divide documentation work (in the User Guide and the Developer Guide) among team members based on enhancements/features each person would be adding</strong><span class="dimmed"> e.g., If you are the person planing to add a feature X, you should be the person to describe the feature X in the User Guide and in the Developer Guide</span>.
      For features that are not planned to be implemented by v1.5, you can divide them based on who will be implementing them if the project were to continue until v2.0.</p>
    <p><span class="dimmed">Reason: In the final project evaluation your documentation skills will be graded based on sections of the User/Developer Guide you have written.</span></p>

    <li><strong>About Us page</strong>:<br> This page is used for module admin purposes. <mark>Please follow the format closely to avoid penalties</mark>.
      <ul>
        <li>Replace info of SE-EDU developers with info of your team, including a <mark>suitable photo</mark> as described
          <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v11-photo">here</trigger>.</li>
        <li>Including the name/photo of the supervisor/lecturer is optional.</li>
        <li>The photo of a team member should be <code>doc/images/githbub_id_in_lower_case.png</code><span class="dimmed">e.g. <code>docs/images/damithc.png</code></span>.</li>

  <modal title="Admin &raquo; Choosing a profile photo" id="modal:v11-photo">
    <div>
      <p>The purpose of the profile photo is for the teaching team to identify you. Therefore, you should choose a recent individual photo showing your face clearly. Some examples can be seen in the 'Teaching team' page. Given below are some examples of
        good and bad profile photos.</p><img src="/website/admin/images/profilephotos.png" style="width: 365.33px"></div>

  <ul>
    <li>Indicate the different roles played and responsibilities held by each team member. You can reassign these roles and responsibilities later in the project, if necessary.</li>
  </ul>
  <panel header="More info on _roles and responsibilities_" expandable="">
    <p><strong>Roles indicates aspects you are in charge of and responsible for.</strong><span class="dimmed">E.g., if you are in charge of documentation, you are the person who should allocate who should write which part, ensure the document is in right format, ensure consistency etc.</span></p>
    <p>Here are some example roles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Team lead</em>: Responsible for overall project coordination.</li>
      <li><em>Documentation</em> (short for ‘in charge of documentation’): Responsible for the quality of various project documents.</li>
      <li><em>Testing</em>: Ensures the testing of the project is done properly and on time.</li>
      <li><em>Code quality</em>: Looks after code quality, ensures adherence to coding standards, etc.</li>
      <li><em>Deliverables and deadlines</em>: Ensure project deliverables are done on time and in the right format.</li>
      <li><em>Integration</em>: In charge of versioning of the code, maintaining the code repository, integrating various parts of the software to create a whole.</li>
      <li><em>Scheduling and tracking</em>: In charge of defining, assigning, and tracking project tasks.</li>
      <li><em>[Tool ABC] expert</em>: <span class="dimmed">e.g. Intellij expert, Git expert, etc.</span> Helps other team member with matters related to the specific tool.</li>
      <li><em>In charge of[Component XYZ]</em>: <span class="dimmed">e.g. In charge of <code>Model</code>, <code>UI</code>, <code>Storage</code>, etc.</span> If you are in charge of a component, you are expected to know that component well, and review changes
        done to that component in v1.3-v1.5.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may define additional roles.</p>
    <p>Please make sure each of the important roles are assigned to one person in the team. It is OK to have a ‘backup’ for each role, but <strong>for each aspect there should be one person who is unequivocally the person responsible for it</strong>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="http://README.md">README.md</a></strong> page: Update it to match your project. In particular, add a UI mockup of your intended final product.<br> Note that the <mark>image of the UI should be <code>docs/images/Ui.png</code></mark>      so that it can be downloaded by our scripts.<br> Also, remember to acknowledge the original source of the code i.e. AddressBook-Level4 project created by SE-EDU initiative at <code>https://github.com/se-edu/</code> You may remove the <code>Learning Outcomes</code>      link and related pages.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Grading</strong>: To consider this milestone as reached, you should have all v1.0 and v1.1 deliverables completed.</p>
