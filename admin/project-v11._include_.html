  <p><img src="/website/admin/images/v01demo.png" width="125px"><br></p>
  <p><span class="dimmed">[An early version of the mobile phone]</span></p>
  <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Move the product from v1.0 towards v2.0 in a small incremental step.</p>
  <p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each member should try to add some enhancements that is in line with the vision for v2.0. Create a PR for the enhancement.</li>
    <li>We encourage enhancements that go beyond the component you are in charge of. Refer to the AddressBook-Level4 Developer Guide has <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s1.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code">some guidance on how to implement a new feature end-to-end</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <tip-box type="important">
    <p><strong>You are required to divide work based on features rather than component</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each team member should implement 1 or more features end-to-end, doing required changes in <em>almost all</em> components. The objective is to force you to learn all components of the software, instead of limiting yourself to your own components.</li>
      <li>You will continue to be in charge of your own components although others will be modifying your components' code. Your role is to help others modify code in your components (you are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about those components) and
        protect your components from degrading. For example, you can review others' changes to your components and suggest possible changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </tip-box>
  <p><strong>Submission</strong>: If you manage to merge any of the PRs, do a demo of the new functionality during the tutorial.</p>
  <p><strong>Grading</strong>: Criteria to consider this milestone as reached</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Minimal ⭐️ : At least some ongoing PRs.</li>
    <li>On track ⭐️⭐️ : At least some PRs merged.</li>
    <li>Ahead ⭐️⭐️⭐️ : Each member has merged at least one PR.</li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>User Guide</strong>:<br> Update the user guide to describe what the product would be like when it is at 2.0. Mark features not implemented yet as <code>Coming in v2.0</code>. You may use UI mockups where necessary. You are recommended to
        divide this task among team members such that <mark>each team member describes the features she will implement if this project were to continue until v2.0</mark><span class="dimmed"> Reason: in the final project submission you will be graded based on the sections of the User Guide you wrote</span>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>About Us page</strong>:<br> This page is used for module admin purposes. <mark>Please follow the format closely to avoid penalties</mark>.</p>
