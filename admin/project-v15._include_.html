<h3 id="v15-demo">v1.5 Demo</h3>
<img src="/website/admin/images/v05demo.png" style="width: 250px">
<ul>
  <li><strong>Venue:</strong> Same as the tutorial venue.</li>
  <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Strictly no more than 3 minutes per person (i.e. a total of 12 minutes for a 4-person team). Exceeding this limit will be penalized.</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Your demo timing is same as your tutorial time in week 13.<br> Starting times: <code>Team B1: 00 minutes, B2: 15 minutes, B3: 30 minutes, B4: 45 minutes</code><br> At least some team members need to arrive 15 minutes ahead
    of the allocated time to set up your computer.<br> There is an <mark>automatic penalty if you are not ready to start on time.</mark>.</li>
  <li><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product.</li>
  <li><strong>Scope</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole, similar to the v1.5rc demo.</li>
      <li>Remember to explain the profile of the target user early in the demo.</li>
      <li>The scenarios you demonstrate should be chosen judiciously so that you cover the full range of your product's functionality. Give more time to stronger features (i.e. cover mundane/basic features fast). It is recommended you showcase how the product
        improves the user‚Äôs life rather than simply describe each feature.</li>
      <li>No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested in those details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
  <li><strong>Structure:</strong><br> Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.<br> Every team member should take part in the demo. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.</li>
  <li><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong><br> Try to make the maximum use of the short demo time in the following ways,
    <ul>
      <li>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.<br> Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch or an
        informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don‚Äôt need to act like an imaginary user. For example, [Instead of this]<code>Jim get‚Äôs a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code><br>        [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type ‚Ä¶</code><br> It‚Äôs not that dramatization is bad or we don‚Äôt like it. We simply don‚Äôt have enough time for it.<br> Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different context
        ‚Üí Different requirements.</li>
      <li>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo. <mark>Demos that are clearly under-prepared will be penalized.</mark></li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt waste time repeating things the target audience already knows. e.g. no need to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</li>
      <li>No need to spend time describing features that existed in original AB4 but you can mention if you did any changes to those features.</li>
      <li>Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all the sample data during the demo itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just 1-2 sample data creates a bad impression
        too.</li>
      <li>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to perform a task before you show the full command with all the bells and whistles.</li>
      <li>Limit the demo to CLI inputs only. There is no point explaining GUI inputs because they don't earn marks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  </tip-box>
  1. [30 minutes] Evaluate the following aspects. Note down your evaluation in a hard copy (as a backup). Submit via TEAMMATES.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>A. Cohesiveness of product features</strong> [üë•üë•]: Do the features fit together and match the target user (and the target problem being addressed)?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>low</code>: Target user/problem not clear from the user guide OR features don't seem to match target user for the most part.</li>
        <li><code>medium</code>: Some features are relevant to the target user but some are not.</li>
        <li><code>high</code>: One of these
          <ul>
            <li>Almost all features are relevant to the target user but the target user is very general</li>
            <li>Almost all features are relevant to the target user but the features are not very high value to the target user</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>excellent</code>: Target user clearly defined (not too general) and almost all new features are of high-value to the target user. i.e. the product is very attractive to the target user.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>B. Quality of user docs</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate based on the parts of the user guide written by the person, as reproduced in the project portfolio. <mark>Evaluate from an end-user perspective.</mark></p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>low</code>: Hard to understand, often inaccurate or missing important information</li>
        <li><code>medium</code>:</li>
        <li><code>high</code>: Mostly easy to follow. Only a few areas for improvements.</li>
        <li><code>excellent</code>: Easy to follow and accurate. Just enough information, visuals, examples etc. (not too much).</li>
        <li><code>unable to judge</code>: not enough content to make a judgement</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>C. Amount of work</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate the amount of work on a scale of 0 to 25</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/440/files">this PR (<code>history</code> command)</a> as 5 units of effort which means <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/610/files">this PR (<code>undo/redo</code> command)</a>          is about 15 points of effort.</li>
        <li>Count all implementation/testing/documentation work mentioned in that person's portfolio page.</li>
        <li>If the features was adapted from another team, count the effort required for adapting it, rather than the effort needed for writing it from scratch.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>D. Depth of features</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate <mark>the strongest feature</mark> done by the developer for difficulty, depth, and completeness. Note: examples given below assumes AB4 did not have commands<code>edit</code><code>undo</code><code>redo</code></p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>low</code> : an easy feature <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. make the existing <em>find</em> command case insensitive</span></li>
        <li><code>medium</code> : moderately difficult feature, barely acceptable implementation <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. an <em>edit</em> command that requires the user to type <em>all</em> fields, even the ones that are not being edited</span></li>
        <li><code>high</code>: one of the below
          <ul>
            <li>A moderately difficult feature but fully implemented <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. an <em>edit</em> command that allows editing any field</span></li>
            <li>A difficult feature with a reasonable implementation but some aspects are not covered <span class="dimmed">¬†undo/redo command that only allows a single undo/redo</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>excellent</code>: A difficult feature, all reasonable aspects are fully implemented <span class="dimmed">¬†undo/redo command that allows multiple undo/redo</span></li>
        <li><code>outstanding</code>: A difficult feature, implemented as good as it can be under the circumstances. <span class="dimmed">¬†undo/redo command that even allows undoing non-mutating commands such as <em>select</em>, allows selectively undo specific commands in the history, etc.</span></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>E. Quality of developer docs</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate based on the developer docs cited/reproduced in the respective project portfolio page. <mark>Evaluate from the perspective of a new developer trying to understand how the features are implemented.</mark></p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>low</code>: One of these
          <ul>
            <li>Very small amount of content (i.e., less than 1 page).</li>
            <li>Hardly any use to the reader (i.e., content doesn't make much sense or redundant).</li>
            <li>Uses ad-hoc diagrams where UML diagrams could have been used instead.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>medium</code>: <em>Some</em> diagrams, <em>some</em> descriptions, but does not help the reader that much.</li>
        <li><code>high</code>: Enough diagrams and enough descriptions (about 2 pages worth) but explanations are not always easy to follow.</li>
        <li><code>excellent</code>: Easy to follow. Just enough information (not too much). Minimum repetition of content/diagrams. Good use of diagrams to complement text descriptions.</li>
        <li><code>unable to judge</code>: not enough content to make a judgement.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Grading:</strong> Your performance in the testathon will be considered for your final grade (under the <em>QA</em> category and under <em>Implementation</em> category)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You will lose marks if you missed too many bugs in the products you tested or your evaluation/estimates are significantly off from the evaluator consensus. <span class="dimmed">¬†Explanation: we penalize if your inputs don't seem be be based on a sincere effort to test/evaluate</span></li>
    <li>The bugs found in your product by others will affect your v1.5 marks. In some cases we'll ask for your input before deciding whether a bug should be penalized <span class="dimmed">¬†i.e. give you a chance to reject false-positive bug reports</span></li>
