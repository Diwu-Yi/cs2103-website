These requirements are specific to this module <span class="dimmed"> i.e., not applicable outside the module (outside the module you should follow the rules specified by your employer and the license of the reused work)</span></p>
                                  <p>If you <strong>used a third party library</strong>:</p>

                                          The <code>//@@author</code> tag should indicates the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code> tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author.
                                          Here is a sample code file:</p>
                                        <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe

                                        <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add the GitHub username to the empty tag later.
                                          Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
                                        <pre class="hljs"><code>method 0 ...

                                          <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
                                          <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>

That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part.

                                  <ol>
                                    <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                                    <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                                    <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                                    <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                                    <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                                    <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                                    <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>
                                  </ol>

Therefore, you should choose a recent individual photo showing your face clearly (i.e., not too small) -- somewhat similar to a passport photo. Some examples can be seen in the 'Teaching team' page. Given below are some examples of good and bad profile photos.<br>

                                              <span class="dimmed">It's similar to giving extra details as appendices; the reader will look at the UG/DG if the PPP is not enough to make a judgment. For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></li>

                                    <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                                    <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                      <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                                      <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                                      <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                                      <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                                      <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                                      <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                                      <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>
                                    </ol>

                      <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early stages of requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
                      <tip-box>
                        <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br>
                            Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
                          <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong>
                            Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
                          <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br>
                            Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
                          <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br>
                            For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>
                            When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
                          <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br>
                            When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
                          <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br>
                            When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </tip-box>

                      <p>💡 Recommended: <strong>You can use GitHub issue tracker to manage user stories</strong>, but for that you need to set up your team's GitHub organization, project fork, and issue tracker first. Instructions for doing those steps are in the panel below.</p>

UML is the brainchild of three software modeling specialists James Rumbaugh, Grady Booch and Ivar Jacobson (also known as the Three Amigos). Each of them has developed their own notation for modeling software systems before joining force to create a unified modeling language (hence, the term ‘Unified’ in UML). UML is currently the <em>de facto</em> modeling notation used in the software industry.</p>
