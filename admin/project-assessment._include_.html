<panel header="1. **Product features** [:busts_in_silhouette::busts_in_silhouette:][5 marks]" expanded="">
  <p>Evaluates: How well do your features fit together to form a cohesive product (not how many features or how big the features are)?</p>
  <p>Based on: user guide and the product demo. The <strong>quality of the demo will be factored in</strong> as well.</p>
  <p>‚ùóÔ∏è ‚ÄòHalf-baked‚Äô (i.e. not production quality) or 'ill-fitting' (feature does not go well with the other features) features will not earn marks at all and could even be penalized. It may be better to remove such features before submission.</p>
</panel>
<panel header="2. **Implementation** [:bust_in_silhouette:][20 marks]" expanded="">
  <p>Evaluates: How good your implementation is, in terms of the <mark>quality and the quantity</mark> of the code you have written yourself.</p>
  <p>Based on: an inspection of the collated code (submitted in your <code>/collated/*.md</code> files).</p>
</panel>
<panel header="3. **QA** [:bust_in_silhouette:][10 marks]" expanded="">
  <p>Evaluates: How good is your Quality Assurance?</p>
  <p>Based on: 1. your test code 2. our own manual testing 3. your performance in the

      <ul>
        <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the risk
          of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
        <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
        <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to what
          extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
        <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code because
          the code has low testability.</li>
