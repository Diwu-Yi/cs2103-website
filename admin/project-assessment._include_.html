<panel header="1. **Product features** [:busts_in_silhouette::busts_in_silhouette:][5 marks]" expanded="">
  <p>Evaluates: How well do your features fit together to form a cohesive product (not how many features or how big the features are)?</p>
  <p>Based on: user guide and the product demo. The <strong>quality of the demo will be factored in</strong> as well.</p>
  <p>‚ùóÔ∏è ‚ÄòHalf-baked‚Äô (i.e. not production quality) or 'ill-fitting' (feature does not go well with the other features) features will not earn marks at all and could even be penalized. It may be better to remove such features before submission.</p>

<panel header="2. **Implementation** [:bust_in_silhouette:][20 marks]" expanded="">
  <p>Evaluates: How good your implementation is, in terms of the <mark>quality and the quantity</mark> of the code you have written yourself.</p>
  <p>Based on: an inspection of the collated code (submitted in your <code>/collated/*.md</code> files).</p>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the risk
          of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
        <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
        <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to what
          extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
        <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code because
          the code has low testability.</li>

    </tip-box>
    1. [30 minutes] Evaluate the following aspects. Note down your evaluation in a hard copy (as a backup). Submit via TEAMMATES.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>A. Cohesiveness of product features</strong> [üë•üë•]: Do the features fit together and match the target user (and the target problem being addressed)?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>low</code>: Target user/problem not clear from the user guide OR features don't seem to match target user for the most part.</li>
          <li><code>medium</code>: Some features are relevant to the target user but some are not.</li>
          <li><code>high</code>: One of these
            <ul>
              <li>Almost all features are relevant to the target user but the target user is very general</li>
              <li>Almost all features are relevant to the target user but the features are not very high value to the target user</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><code>excellent</code>: Target user clearly defined (not too general) and almost all new features are of high-value to the target user. i.e. the product is very attractive to the target user.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>B. Quality of the user docs</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate based on the parts of the user guide written by the person, as reproduced in the project portfolio. <mark>Evaluate from an end-user perspective.</mark></p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>unable to judge</code>: not enough content to make a judgement</li>
          <li><code>low</code>: Hard to understand, often inaccurate or missing important information</li>
          <li><code>medium</code>:</li>
          <li><code>high</code>: Mostly easy to follow. Only a few areas for improvements.</li>
          <li><code>excellent</code>: Easy to follow and accurate. Just enough information, visuals, examples etc. (not too much).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>C. Development effort</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate the amount of coding effort on a scale of 0 to 25</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Consider <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/440/files">this PR (<code>history</code> command)</a> as 5 units of effort which means <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/610/files">this PR (<code>undo/redo</code> command)</a>            is about 15 points of effort.</li>
          <li>Count all implementation/testing/documentation work mentioned in that person's portfolio page.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>D. Depth of features</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate <mark>the strongest feature</mark> done by the developer for difficulty, depth, and completeness. Note: examples given below assumes AB4 did not have commands<code>edit</code><code>undo</code><code>redo</code></p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>low</code> : an easy feature <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. make the existing <em>find</em> command case insensitive</span></li>
          <li><code>medium</code> : moderately difficult feature, barely acceptable implementation <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. an <em>edit</em> command that requires the user to type <em>all</em> fields, even the ones that are not being edited</span></li>
          <li><code>high</code>: one of the below
            <ul>
              <li>A moderately difficult feature but fully implemented <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. an <em>edit</em> command that allows editing any field</span></li>
              <li>A difficult feature with a reasonable implementation but some aspects are not covered <span class="dimmed">¬†undo/redo command that only allows a single undo/redo</span></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><code>excellent</code>: A difficult feature, all reasonable aspects are fully implemented <span class="dimmed">¬†undo/redo command that allows multiple undo/redo</span></li>
          <li><code>over the top</code>: A difficult feature, implemented as good as it can be under the circumstances. <span class="dimmed">¬†undo/redo command that even allows undoing non-mutating commands such as <em>select</em>, allows selectively undo specific commands in the history, etc.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>E. Quality of the developer docs</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate based on the developer docs cited/reproduced in the respective project portfolio page. <mark>Evaluate from the perspective of a new developer trying to understand how the features are implemented.</mark></p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>unable to judge</code>: not enough content to make a judgement.</li>
          <li><code>low</code>: One of these
            <ul>
              <li>Very small amount of content (i.e., less than 1 page).</li>
              <li>Hardly any use to the reader (i.e., content doesn't make much sense or redundant).</li>
              <li>Uses ad-hoc diagrams where UML diagrams could have been used instead.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><code>medium</code>: <em>Some</em> diagrams, <em>some</em> descriptions, but does not help the reader that much.</li>
          <li><code>high</code>: Enough diagrams and enough descriptions (about 2 pages worth) but explanations are not always easy to follow.</li>
          <li><code>excellent</code>: Easy to follow. Just enough information (not too much). Minimum repetition of content/diagrams. Good use of diagrams to complement text descriptions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Grading:</strong> Your performance in the testathon will be considered for your final grade (under the <em>QA</em> category and under <em>Implementation</em> category)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You will lose marks if you missed too many bugs in the products you tested or your evaluation/estimates are significantly off from the evaluator consensus. <span class="dimmed">¬†Explanation: we penalize if your inputs don't seem be be based on a sincere effort to test/evaluate</span></li>
      <li>The bugs found in your product by others will affect your v1.5 marks. In some cases we'll ask for your input before deciding whether a bug should be penalized <span class="dimmed">¬†i.e. give you a chance to reject false-positive bug reports</span></li>
