<p><code>rc</code> = Release Candidate</p>
<h3 id="v15rc-project-management">v1.5rc Project Management</h3>
<p>We strongly recommend you to <strong>freeze features</strong> after reaching this milestone. As this is a release candidate, it should have all the features you intend to release at v1.5. Adding more features after this point is risky. The remaining time
  should be left aside for fixing problems discovered late.</p>
<h3 id="v15rc-product">v1.5rc Product</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Increase code coverage by adding more tests if it is lower than the level you would like it to be.</li>
  <li>After you have sufficient code coverage, fix remaining code quality problems and bring up the quality to your target level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submission</strong>: as before.</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>: as before.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>For you to use (e.g. in your resume) as a well-documented data point of your SE experience</li>
          <li>For us to use as a data point to evaluate your contributions to the project and your documentation skills</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Format</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Follow the <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s1.github.io/addressbook-level4/team/johndoe.html">example in the AddressBook-Level4</a>.</li>
          <li>Main things to include: features you implemented, features you propose to implement in future, other major contributions to the project<br> Other things you can include: Evidence of helping others <span class="dimmed"> e.g. responses you posted in our forum</span>,
            Evidence of technical leadership <span class="dimmed"> e.g. offering features for others to reuse, evidence of those features being reused by others</span><br> If you plan to use the PPP in your Resume, you can also include your SE work outside
            of the module (will not be graded)</li>
          <li>Tip: You can use the <a href="http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#include-files">Asciidoc's <code>include</code> feature</a> to include sections from the developer guide or the user guide in your PPP. Follow the example
            in the <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s1.github.io/addressbook-level4/team/johndoe.html">sample</a>.</li>
          <li>Important: It is assumed that sections <em>included</em> in this way were written primarily by you. If those sections were written by someone else <span class="dimmed"> e.g. someone else wrote described the feature in the User Guide but you implemented the feature</span>,
            clearly state that the section was written by someone else <span class="dimmed"> (e.g. <code>Start of Extract [from: User Guide] written by Jane Doe</code>)</span>. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: Your writing skills will be evaluated based on the PPP</span></li>

<p><strong>Submission</strong>: Must be included in the version tagged <code>v1.5rc</code>.</p>
<h3 id="v15rc-demo">v1.5rc Demo</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Duration: ~3 minutes (max) per person <span class="dimmed">  a 4-member team will have 12 minutes</span></li>
  <li>Organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole. Unlike in v1.2-v1.4 demos, there is no need for each person to demo their own features.</li>
  <li>It <mark>should be a 'well prepared' demo</mark>. You should know in advance exactly what you'll do in the demo.</li>
  <li>It is <mark>a <em>sitting down</em> demo</mark>: You'll be demonstrating the features using the TV while sitting down.</li>
  <li>It will be uninterrupted demo: The tutor will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish within the given time.</li>
  <li>The app should be populated with a significant amount of realistic data at the start. e.g at least 20 contacts.</li>
</ul>
