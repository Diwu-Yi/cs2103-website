  <p><strong>v1.2 Summary of Deliverables</strong></p>
  <p>Here is a summary of individual and team deliverables for v1.2 to consider it as <em>reached</em>. See sections below for more details of each deliverable. Individual deliverables and team deliverables are considered separately for grading <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. if a team member fail individual deliverables for more than two milestones, only that member's marks will be affected</span>.</p>

<h3 id="v12-project-management">v1.2 Project Management</h3>
<tip-box type="important">
  <p>Starting from this version, <mark>there are additional requirements to follow</mark> regarding how you <strong>use GitHub to manage your milestones</strong>, as described in
    <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v12-projectTracking">[Admin ¬ª Appendix E: GitHub: Project Schedule Tracking]</trigger>.</p>
</tip-box>
<p>As before, you are <em>recommended</em> (but not required) to <strong>follow the forking workflow</strong> when evolving the product.</p>
<modal large="" title="Admin &raquo; Appendix E: Github: Project Schedule Tracking" id="modal:v12-projectTracking">
  <div>
    <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
    <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current
      status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
    <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g.</span><code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br><code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="dimmed">üëç Good:¬†Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.5</span></li>
          <li><span class="dimmed">üëé Bad¬†(reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough):¬†Write the project manual</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Write a descriptive title for the issue.</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a¬†single person¬†to do¬†within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>Implementing parser</code><span class="dimmed">: too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week.</span></li>
          <li><code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code><span class="dimmed">: appropriate size.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal description
          is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Assign tasks to team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Optionally, you can use <code>status.ongoing</code> label to indicate issues currently ongoing.</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div id="using-milestones">
      <h3 id="using-milestones">Using Milestones:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-milestones/">GitHub milestones</a> to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone by assigning issues to suitable milestones.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <tip-box type="important">
        <p>To consider the milestone as 'reached', <strong>you should have the following done <em>before</em> the tutorial begins. Missed milestones will count against the 'project management' component of your final grade</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. v1.2) and pushed to the main repo.</li>
          <li>All tests passing on Travis.</li>
          <li>Milestone updated to match the product.</li>
          <li>Milestone closed. All issues assigned to that milestone should be closed too.</li>
          <li>Optionally, issues for next milestone are assigned to team members (this is not compulsory to do <em>before</em> the tutorial, but we recommend you to do it soon after the tutorial)</li>
          <li>Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for v1.1 and v1.2 but compulsory from v1.3.</li>
        </ul>
      </tip-box>

<ul>
  <li>[Preferred] Deliver it in smaller incremental steps e.g. deliver a basic version of the enhancement first.</li>
  <li>Do a different, smaller, enhancement for the current week while working on a bigger enhancement to deliver in a future week.</li>
  <li>Choose not contribute to the weekly milestone. This should be fine as long as you don't miss more than two milestones.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v12-product">v1.2 Product</h3>
<p><strong>Submission</strong>: Update code in GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>: Criteria to consider this milestone as reached</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new version tagged <code>v1.2</code> is in your repo. <span class="dimmed">¬†If <code>v1.2</code> is already used by a past commit, you can use something similar such as <code>V1.2</code> or <code>v1.2.0</code>.</span></li>
  <li>The version <code>v1.2</code> is step towards <code>v2.0</code> (but it does not matter how big a step it is)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v12-documentation">v1.2 Documentation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>User Guide</strong>: Update as necessary.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a feature has been released in this version, replace the <code>Coming in v2.0</code> annotation with a <code>Since v1.2</code>. Also replace UI mockups with actual screenshots.</li>
      <li>If a feature design has changed, update the descriptions accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Developer Guide</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><mark>Each member should describe the implementation of at least one enhancement she has added</mark> (or planning to add). <br> Expected length: ~1 page per person</li>
      <li>The description can contain things such as,
        <ul>
          <li>How the feature is implemented.</li>
          <li>Why it is implemented that way.</li>
          <li>Alternatives considered.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The stated objective is to explain the implementation to a future developer, but a hidden objective is to show evidence that you can document deeply-technical content using prose, examples, diagrams, code snippets, etc. appropriately. To that end,
        you may also describe features that you plan to implement in the future, even beyond v1.5 (hypothetically).</li>
      <li>For an example, see <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s1.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#undo-redo-mechanism">the description of the undo/redo feature implementation in the AddressBook-Level4 developer guide</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v12-demo">v1.2 Demo</h3>
<p>Do an informal demo of the new feature during the tutorial. <mark>Each team member should demo their own work, using the <code>master</code> branch.</mark></p>
