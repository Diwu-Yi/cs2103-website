**v1.0 Summary of Milestone**

Here is a summary of items you need to deliver to _reach_ v1.1 individual (:bust_in_silhouette:) and team (:busts_in_silhouette:) milestones. See sections below for more details of each item. 

Milestone | Minimum acceptable performance to consider as 'reached'
--------- | -------------------------------------------------------
:busts_in_silhouette: requirements documented | a draft of v2.0 requirements in some form
:bust_in_silhouette: [optional] product survey documented | none
:busts_in_silhouette: v2.0 conceptualized | a draft of v2.0 user guide in some form

:exclamation: ==Reaching individual and team milestones are considered for grading== the _project management_ component of your project grade (expand the panel below for more info).

### v1.0 Documentation

* **Developer Guide**:
  Have a draft of the requirements of your project, as described in mid-v1.0 progress guide.
  
* **User Guide**:  
  Draft a user guide in a convenient format (e.g., a GoogleDoc) to describe what the product would be like when it is at 2.0.  We recommend that ou follow the existing <tooltip content="AddressBook-Level4">AB4</tooltip> User Guide in terms of structure and format.

  <tip-box> 
  
  :bulb: It is highly recommended that you **divide documentation work (in the User Guide and the Developer Guide) among team members based on enhancements/features each person would be adding** %%&nbsp;e.g., If you are the person planing to add a feature X, you should be the person to describe the feature X in the User Guide and in the Developer Guide%%. For features that are not planned to be implemented by v1.4, you can divide them based on who will be implementing them _if_ the project were to continue until v2.0 (hypothetically).
  
  %%Reason: In the final project evaluation your documentation skills will be graded based on sections of the User/Developer Guide you have written.%%

**Suggested length**: Follow the existing user guide and developer guides in terms of the level of details.

**Submission**: Show to the tutor during the tutorial.
