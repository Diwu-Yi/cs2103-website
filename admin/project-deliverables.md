To expedite your project implementation, you will be given some sample code (AddressBook-Level1 to AddressBook-Level4, shown as `AB1` to `AB4` in the diagram above) that you can use as the basis for improving your individual skills during Phases A and as the basis for your project in Phase B.

`AB4` is the version you will use as the starting point for your final project. Some of the work you do in `AB1` to `AB3` can be ported over to `AB4` and can be used to claim credit in the final project. 

Given below is the high-level time line of the project.

Week         | Activities
-------------|-----------
3            | decide on a overall project direction (user profile, optimize or morph?, problem addressed)
4 (mid-v1.0) | decide on requirements (user stories, use cases, non-functional requirements)
5 (v1.0)     | conceptualize product and document it as a user guide(draft)
6 (mid-v1.1) | set up project repo, start moving UG and DG to the repo 
7 (v1.1)     | update UG and DG in the repo, do small changes to the code base
8 (mid-v1.2) | adjust project rigor as needed, complete repo set up, start proper milestone management
9 (v1.2)     | move code towards v2.0 in small steps
10 (mid-v1.3)| update DG to explain design/implementation of new features, continue to enhance features 
11 (v1.3)    | release as a jar file, release updated user guide, peer-test released products, verify code authorship 
12 (mid-v1.4)| tweak as per peer-testing results, draft Project Portfolio Page, practice product demo 
13 (v1.4)    | final tweaks to docs/product, release product, demo product, test/evaluate peer products

The sub-sections further down explain each project deliverable in detail and states some recommended progress for you to achieve at that point of the project.
