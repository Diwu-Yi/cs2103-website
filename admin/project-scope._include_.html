<p>In general, each team is expected to take one of these two directions:</p>
<p><strong>[Direction 1]  <em>Optimize</em></strong> AddressBook for a specific target user:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define a very specific target user profile. <br> ðŸ’¡ We recommend you narrow down the target user profile as much as you can <span class="dimmed">Â as opposed to trying to make it as general as possible. Here is an example direction of narrowing down target user: anybody â†’ teachers â†’ university teachers â†’ tech savvy university teachers â†’ CS2103 instructors.</span></li>
  <li>Optimize the AddressBook for those specific target users <span class="dimmed">Â i.e., add features that are only applicable for those users to make the app especially attractive to them. To add to the example in the previous point, there can be features that are applicable to CS2103 instructors only, such as the ability to pull down a student's photo from IVLE or navigate to a student's project on GitHub</span></li>
</ul>
<panel header="Examples for _optimize_ direction" expanded="">
  <ul>
    <li>for users in a specific profession <span class="dimmed">Â e.g. doctors, salesmen, teachers, etc.</span></li>
    <li>for users dealing with a huge number of contacts <span class="dimmed">Â e.g. HR admins, user group admins</span></li>
    <li>based on what users do with the contacts <span class="dimmed">Â e.g. organize group events, share info, do business, do analytics</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
</panel>
<p></p>
<p><strong>[Direction 2] <em>Morph</em></strong> AddressBook into a different product: Given that AddressBook is a generic app that manages a type of elements (i.e. contacts), you can use it as a starting point to create an app that manages something else.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is a high-risk high-reward option because morphing requires extra work but a morphed product may earn more marks than an optimized product of similar complexity.</li>
  <li>As mentioned in the <em>optimize</em> direction, this direction too requires you to define a narrow target user profile.</li>
</ul>
<panel header="Examples for _morph_ direction" expanded="">
  <p>An app to manage, * Bookmarks of websites * Tasks/Schedule * Forum posts, news feeds, Social media feeds * Online projects or issue trackers that the user is interested in * Emails, possibly from different accounts</p>

<li>A major redesign of the GUI <span class="dimmed">e.g. make it work like a chat application (note: chat is a form of CLI)</span></li>

  <p>Here are some examples of different major enhancements and the grade the student is likely to earn for the relevant parts of the project grade.</p>

  <p><strong>Contribute one <em>minor</em> enhancements to the product</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the initial stages of the project you are required to add one small generic enhancements in order to get familiar with the project.</li>
    <li>Minor enhancements earn a minimal amount of marks. You are advised not to spend a lot of effort on the minor enhancement.</li>
    <li>The minor enhancement must touch multiple components <span class="dimmed">Â  so that it helps you to familiarize yourself wit the codebase</span>.</li>

    you did not do.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p><strong>Do a share of team-tasks</strong>: These are the tasks that <em>someone</em> in the team has to do. Marks allocated to team-tasks will be divided among team members based on how much each member contributed to those tasks.</p>

a. Enhancements added fit together to form a cohesive product.
b. Documentation follows a consistent style and presents a cohesive picture to the reader.
c. Final project demo presents a cohesive picture to the audience.</li><li><strong>Maintain product quality</strong>: i.e. prevent regressions in other parts of the product as the product evolves. Note that bugs local to a specific feature will be counted against the author of that feature.
