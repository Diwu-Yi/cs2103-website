This is a good time to analyze requirements with a view to conceptualizing the next version of the product (i.e. v2.0).

* **Set up a weekly project meeting time/venue with your team members**
  We recommend at least one face-to-face project meeting per week. The project meeting time can be used to discuss project related things, but also, can be used as a time for team members to work on the project tasks individually (having all members in the same place will facilitate easier collaboration and more peer-learning).

* **Decide project direction, target user profile, and problem addressed**
  Use your first project meeting to discuss with your team members and decide your project direction, target user profile, and the value proposition of the product, as described in <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-scope">[Admin {{ icon_embedding }} Project Scope]</trigger> 

<modal large title="Admin {{ icon_embedding }} Project Scope (Extract)" id="modal:v10-scope">
