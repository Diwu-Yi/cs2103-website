<tip-box> 

* :exclamation: **Penalty for late submission:** ==-1 mark for each hour delayed, up to 3 hours.== Even a 1-second delay is considered late, irrespective of the reason. Penalty for delays beyond 3 hours are determined on a case by case basis. 
  * For submissions done via IVLE, the submission time is the timestamp shown by IVLE.
  * When determining the late submission penalty, **we take the latest submission** even if the same exact file was submitted earlier. Do not submit the same file multiple times if you want to avoid unnecessary late submission penalties.
* The whole team is penalized for problems in team submissions. Only the respective student is penalized for problems in individual submissions. 
* :exclamation: Please **follow submission instructions closely**. ==Any non-compliance will be penalized==. e.g. wrong file name, team member photos not suitable, etc.
* For pdf submissions, ensure the file is usable and hyperlinks in the file are correct. Problems in documents are considered bugs too %%&nbsp;e.g. broken links, outdated diagrams/instructions etc.%%.
* **Do not update the repo during the 14 days after the deadline.** Get our permission first if you need to update the repo during that _freeze_ period. You can continue to evolve your repo after that.
