    <p>Collate is a tool for collating code written by different developers.</p>
<p>Steps to use Collate:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
  <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
  <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="annotating-code-to-indicate-authorship">Annotating code to indicate authorship</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.<br> The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code> tag
      or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author. Here is a sample code file:</p>
    <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author sarahkhoo
method 3 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add the GitHub
      username to the empty tag later. Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
    <pre class="hljs"><code>method 0 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author
method 3 ...
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The author tag syntax varies based on file type</strong> e.g. for java, css, fxml. Use the corresponding comment syntax for non-Java files.<br> Here is an example code from an xml file.</p>
    <pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;!-- @@author sereneWong --&gt;
&lt;textbox&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;...&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input&gt;...&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;/textbox&gt;
...
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments</strong> as only the content below that tag will be collated.<br> üëé‚§µÔ∏è
    </p>
    <pre class="hljs"><code>/**
  * Returns true if ...
  * @@author johndoe
  */
</code></pre>
    <p>üëç‚§µÔ∏è</p>
    <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
/**
  * Returns true if ...
  */
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-to-and-what-not-to-annotate">What to and what not to annotate</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Annotate both functional and test code but not documentation files.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Annotate only significant size code blocks that can be reviewed on its own</strong> <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g., a class, a sequence of methods, a  method.</span> <br> <strong>Claiming credit for code blocks smaller than a method is discouraged</strong>      but allowed. If you do, do it sparingly and only claim meaningful blocks of code such as a block of statements, a loop, or an if-else statement%%.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to collate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
      <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
      <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>
      <li>üí° GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/"><em>blame</em> feature and a <em>history</em></a> feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do not try to boost the length of your collated files using dubious means</strong> such as duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even repetitive code blocks within
      test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.<br> Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice a team member claiming credit for
      code that he/she did not write or use other questionable tactics, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product</strong>,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code></li>
      <li>Move unused files (or copies of files containing unused code) to that folder</li>
      <li>use <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}-unused</code> to mark unused code in those files (note the suffix <code>unused</code>) e.g.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe-unused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
    <p>Please put a comment in the code to explain why it was not used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>If you reused code from elsewhere,</strong> mark such code as <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}-reused</code> (note the suffix <code>reused</code>) e.g.
    </p>
    <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe-reused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For code generated by the IDE/framework,</strong> should not be annotated as your own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Code you modified in minor ways</strong> e.g. adding a parameter. These can be left out of collated code but can be mentioned in the Project Portfolio page if you want to claim credit for them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="collating-the-annotated-code">Collating the annotated code</h4>
<p>You need to put the collated code in the following folders</p>
<table class="markbind-table table table-bordered table-striped">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Code Type</th>
      <th>Folder</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>functional code</td>
      <td><code>collated/functional</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>test code</td>
      <td><code>collated/test</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>unused code</td>
      <td><code>collated/unused</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate/blob/master/docs/User-Guide.md">Collate Tool's user guide</a> to find how to run the tool over the annotated code.</p>
<p>Given below are DOS sample commands you can put in a batch file and run it to collate the code.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from src/main to collated/functional include java, fxml, css

java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from src/test to collated/test include java

java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from unused to collated/unused include java, fxml, css
</code></pre>
<p>The output should be something like the structure given below.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>collated/
    functional/
        johndoe.md
        sarahkhoo.md
        ravikumar.md
        ravikumarreused.md
    test/
        johndoe.md
        sarahkhoo.md
        ravikumar.md
    unused/
        johndoe.md
</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>After running the collate tool, you are recommended to look through the generated <strong>.md</strong> files to ensure all your code has been extracted correctly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><mark>Push the *.md files created to a folder called /collated</mark> in your repo.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
