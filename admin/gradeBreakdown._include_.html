      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Quality</strong>: Does not deliver work products that seem to be below the student's competence level i.e. tries their best to make the work product as high quality as possible within her competency level.</p>

        </ul>

    <p>The following criteria will be assessed but <strong>considered only for pushing a student's grade from A to A+ and recruiting future tutors/interns</strong>.</p>
    <ul>

    <p>No midterm.<br> Final exam:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 hours, open book, MCQ and essay type questions, covers Learning Outcomes (LOs) of up to ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è level.</li>
      <li><mark>This semester's exam paper will be very different from previous years</mark>. A sample will be provided near to the exam. You are recommended not to rely on past exam papers.</li>
      <li>Exam consultations (consultations near the exam) are discouraged but allowed. We prefer you to learn and clarify along the way, not at the end.</li>
      <li>Study tips:
        <ul>
          <li>Go through the worked examples in the module website under each LO.</li>
          <li>Learn all parts of the project, not just the part you did.</li>
          <li>Explore how your project can be extended to support more features.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that a large part of CS2103 exam paper measures how well you can apply SE theory to a project. Therefore, the exam is strongly connected to the project and how you ¬†applied theory in the project. The exam will be easy for you if you attend lectures,
      participate in tutorials(tutorials too are focused on application of theory to the project), and do a sincere job in the project. <mark>You will not be able to ace the exams by simply doing past papers just before the exams.</mark></p><img src="/website/admin/images/exam.png"

<panel header="[50%] Project" minmized="">
  <div>
    <p>Note that project grading is <mark>not competitive (not bell curved)</mark>. <mark>CS2103T projects will be assessed separately from CS2103 projects.</mark> This is to account for the perceived difference in workload. Given below is the marking scheme.</p>
    <p><strong>Total</strong>: 50 marks (üë§ 40 individual marks + üë•üë• 10 team marks)</p>
    <panel header="1. **Product features** [:busts_in_silhouette::busts_in_silhouette:][5 marks]" expanded="">
      <p>Evaluates: How well do your features fit together to form a cohesive product (not how many features or how big the features are)?</p>
      <p>Based on: user guide and the product demo. The <strong>quality of the demo will be factored in</strong> as well.</p>
      <p>‚ùóÔ∏è ‚ÄòHalf-baked‚Äô (i.e. not production quality) or 'ill-fitting' (feature does not go well with the other features) features will not earn marks at all and could even be penalized. It may be better to remove such features before submission.</p>

    <panel header="2. **Implementation** [:bust_in_silhouette:][20 marks]" expanded="">
      <p>Evaluates: How good your implementation is, in terms of the <mark>quality and the quantity</mark> of the code you have written yourself.</p>
      <p>Based on: an inspection of the collated code (submitted in your <code>/collated/*.md</code> files).</p>
    </panel>
    <panel header="3. **QA** [:bust_in_silhouette:][10 marks]" expanded="">
      <p>Evaluates: How good is your Quality Assurance?</p>
      <p>Based on: 1. your test code 2. our own manual testing 3. your performance in the

      <panel type="seamless" header="Expectations for writing automated tests:" expanded="">
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the
              risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
            <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
            <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to
              what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
            <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code
              because the code has low testability.</li>
