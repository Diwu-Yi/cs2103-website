# Participation Marks

Participation marks for each phase is ==given on a 'all or nothing' basis== %%&nbsp;i.e., you get either `5` or `0` marks%%.

To get the full marks allocated for participation you should meet a minimal bar on all the following criteria, ==evaluated based on peer evaluations and tutor observations==. We will also take into account data recorded in other systems e.g. GitHub, IVLE.

* **Professional Communication** : 
  * Communicates sufficiently and professionally. e.g. Does not use offensive language or excessive slang in project communications.
  * Responds to communication from team members in a timely manner (e.g. within 24 hours).

* **Punctuality**: Does not cause others to waste time or slow down project progress by frequent tardiness.

* **Dependability**: Promises what can be done, and delivers what was promised.

* **Effort**: Puts in sufficient effort to, and tries their best to, keep up with the module/project pace. Seeks help from others when necessary.

* **Quality**: Does not deliver work products that seem to be below the student's competence level i.e. tries their best to make the work product as high quality as possible within her competency level.

* **Meticulousness**:
  * Rarely overlooks submission requirements.
  * Rarely misses compulsory module activities such as completing the TEAMMATES profile or peer review.

* **Teamwork**: How willing are you to act as part of a team, contribute to team-level tasks, adhere to team decisions, etc.

:exclamation: you will lose _all_ participation marks if,
* if you receive **multiple `Below Average`/`Poor` ratings** for any of the criteria above, or, 
* if you **miss more than one compulsory tasks** %%&nbsp;(e.g. submitting peer evaluations, taking part in peer testing, compulsory LOs)%%
  
The following criteria will be assessed but **considered only for pushing a student's grade from A to A+ and recruiting future tutors/interns**.

* **Technical Competency**: Able to gain competency in all the required tools and techniques.
