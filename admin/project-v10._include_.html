  <p><strong>Objective</strong>: To analyze requirements, conceptualize the next version of the product (i.e. v2.0), and document it.</p>
  <h4 id="step-1-brainstorm-user-stories">Step 1 : Brainstorm user stories</h4><img src="/website/admin/images/v00.png" width="250px">
  <p>Get together with your team members and brainstorm user stories <strong>for the v2.0 of the product</strong>. Note that in the project you will deliver only up to v1.5 but here you should consider up to v2.0 (i.e. beyond the module).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>It is ok to have more user stories than you can deliver in the project. <span class="dimmed">Aim to create at least 30 user stories. Include all 'obvious' ones you can think of but also look for 'non obvious' ones that you think are likely to be missed by other teams.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You can write each user story in a piece of paper (e.g. yellow sticky note, index card, or just pieces of paper about the size of a playing card). Alternatively you can use an online tool (some examples given below).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

    <tab header="GitHub Project Boards">
      <p>You can create issues for each of the user stories and use a GitHub <em>Project Board</em> to sort them into categories.</p>

  <p>Based on your user story categorization in step 1, given project requirements, and the current state of the product, select which user stories you are likely to include in v2.0.</p>
  <p>Update the following pages of the Developer Guide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Stories</strong>: Give a list of the user stories, including priorities. This can include user stories considered but will not be included in the final product.</li>
    <li><strong>Use cases</strong>: Give use cases (textual form) for a few representative user stories that need multiple steps to complete. <span class="dimmed">e.g. Adding a tag to a person (assume the user needs to find the person first)</span></li>
    <li><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong>:<br> Note: Many of the project constraints mentioned above are NFRs. You can add more. e.g. performance requirements, usability requirements, scalability requirements, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Glossary</strong>: Define terms that are worth defining.</li>
    <li><strong>Product survey</strong> [Optional]: Explore a few similar/related products and describe your findings i.e. Pros, cons, (from the target user's point of view).</li>

  <p><strong>Grading</strong>: <mark>Reaching this milestone (and future milestones) will be counted under 'Project management' component of the final project grade.</mark> To claim this milestone as 'reached', you should at least have a full draft version
    of the above documents in some format (e.g. GoogleDoc), even if you did not have time to update the documents in the repo.</p>
</div>
<div id="product">
  <h3 id="v10-product">v1.0 Product</h3>
  <p><strong>Objective</strong>: To familiarize yourself with the code.</p>
  <p><strong>Description</strong>: Divide the
    <tooltip content="components as stated in the [Developer Guide: Architecture]">components</tooltip> among yourselves. Each member can do some small enhancements to their component(s) to learn the code of that component. Some suggested enhancements are given in the <a href="https://nus-cs2103-AY1718S1.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#improving-each-component">AddressBook-Level4 developer guide</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Create PRs from your own fork to your team repo.</p>
  <p><strong>Grading</strong>: This is an individual milestone. Considered reached if you have at least attempted to enhance the code of a component, even if you did not fully succeed.</p>
