### v1.2 Project Management

<tip-box type="important">

Starting from this version, you are _required_ to, **use GitHub to manage your milestones** as described in <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v12-projectTracking">[Admin &raquo; Appendix F: Github: Project Schedule Tracking]</trigger>.

</tip-box>

As before, you are _recommended_ (but not required) to follow the forking workflow when evolving the product.

### v1.2 Product

**Submission**: Update code in GitHub.

**Grading**: Criteria to consider this milestone as reached
* A new version tagged `v1.2` is in your repo.
* The version `v1.2` is step towards `v2.0` (but it does not matter how big a step it is)

### v1.2 Documentation

* **User Guide**: Update as necessary.
  * If a feature has been released in this version, replace the `Coming in v2.0` annotation with a `Since v1.2`. Also replace UI mockups with actual screenshots.
  * If a feature design has changed, update the descriptions accordingly.

* **Developer Guide**:
  * Each member should describe the implementation of at least one enhancement she has added (or planning to add). <br>
    Expected length: ~1 page per person
  * The description can contain things such as,
    * How the feature is implemented.
    * Why it is implemented that way.
    * Alternatives considered.
  * The stated objective is to explain the implementation to a future developer, but a hidden objective is to show evidence that you can document deeply-technical content using prose, examples, diagrams, code snippets, etc. appropriately. To that end, you may also describe features that you plan to implement in the future, even beyond v1.5 (hypothetically).
  * For an example, see [the description of the undo/redo feature implementation in the AddressBook-Level4 developer guide](https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s1.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#undo-redo-mechanism).
  

### v1.2 Demo

Do an informal demo of the new feature during the tutorial.
