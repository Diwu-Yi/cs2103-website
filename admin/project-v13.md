### v1.3 Project Management

<tip-box type="important">

Starting from this version, you are _required_ to, **do a proper product release** as described in the Developer Guide.

</tip-box>

<tip-box type="tip"> 

Ensure that **each PR that adds an enhancement also updates the relevant parts of documents and tests**. That way, your documentation/testing work will not pile up towards the end.

</tip-box>


### v1.3 Product

**Submission**: Do a release on GitHub

**Grading**: 

Criteria to consider this milestone as reached:
* The new version has moved towards v2.0 compared to the previous version.
* The milestone is wrapped up and the release has been done.
 

### v1.3 Documentation

* **User Guide**: Update where the document does not match the current product.
* **Developer Guide**: Similar to User Guide.

**Submission**: Must be included in the version tagged `v1.3`.

**Grading**: To consider this milestone as reached, your documentation should not be noticeably behind the product.  


### v1.3 Demo

Do an informal demo of the new features during the tutorial. Each person should demo their own contributions. 

<tip-box type="important">

Starting from this version, you should **use the jar file** (downloaded from GitHub release) for the demo, not the code loaded into the IDE.
