  <div>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
      <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
      <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="annotating-code-to-indicate-authorship">Annotating code to indicate authorship</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author github-ID</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.<br> The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code> tag or the
          end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author. Here is a sample code file:</p>
        <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author sarahkhoo
method 3 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub ID) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add the GitHub ID
          to the empty tag later. Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
        <pre class="hljs"><code>method 0 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author
method 3 ...
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>The author tag syntax varies based on file type</strong> e.g. for java, css, fxml. Use the corresponding comment syntax for non-Java files.<br> Here is an example code from an xml file.</p>
        <pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;!-- @@author github-ID --&gt;
&lt;textbox&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;...&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input&gt;...
&lt;/textbox&gt;
...
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments</strong> as only the content below that tag will be collated.<br> üëé‚§µÔ∏è
        </p>
        <pre class="hljs"><code>/**

    <h4 id="what-to-and-what-not-to-annotate">What to and what not to annotate</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Annotate both functional and test code but not documentation files.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Annotate only significant size code blocks that can be reviewed on its own</strong><span class="dimmed">¬†e.g., a class, a sequence of methods, a  method.</span><br><strong>Claiming credit for code blocks smaller than a method is discouraged</strong>          but allowed. If you do, do it sparingly and only claim meaningful blocks of code such as a block of statements, a loop, or an if-else statement%%.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to collate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
          <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
          <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>
          <li>üí° GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/"><em>blame</em> feature and a <em>history</em></a> feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>You will be penalized if you try to boost the length of your collated files using dubious means</strong> such as duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even
          repetitive code blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.<br> Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice
          a team member claiming credit for code that he/she did not write, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product</strong>,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code></li>
          <li>Move unused files (or copies of files containing unused code) to that folder</li>
          <li>use <code>//@@author github-ID-unused</code> to mark unused code in those files (note the suffix <code>unused</code>) e.g.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe-unused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
        <p>Please put a comment in the code to explain why it was not used.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>If you reused code from elsewhere,</strong> mark such code as <code>//@@author github-ID-reused</code> (note the suffix <code>reused</code>) e.g.
        </p>
        <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe-reused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>For code generated by the IDE/framework,</strong> should not be annotated as your own.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Code you modified in minor ways</strong> e.g. adding a parameter. These can be left out of collated code but can be mentioned in the Project Portfolio page if you want to claim credit for them.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="collating-the-annotated-code">Collating the annotated code</h4>
    <p>You need to put the collated code in the following folders</p>
    <table class="markbind-table table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Code Type</th>
          <th>Folder</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>

          <td><code>collated/functional</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>test code</td>
          <td><code>collated/test</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>unused code</td>
          <td><code>collated/unused</code></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Refer to <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate/blob/master/docs/User-Guide.md">Collate Tool's user guide</a> to find how to run the tool over the annotated code.</p>
    <p>Given below are DOS sample commands you can put in a batch file and run it to collate the code.</p>
    <pre class="hljs"><code>java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from src/main to collated/functional include java, fxml, css

<p>As before.</p>
<h3 id="v14-acceptance-testing">v1.4 Acceptance Testing</h3>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>To train you</strong> to do manual testing, bug reporting, bug triaging, bug fixing, communicating with users, evaluating products etc. (Note: <mark>you will be doing a graded acceptance testing session in week 13</mark>; this session will serve
    as practice for that)</li>
  <li><strong>To help you improve your product</strong> before the final submission.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When, where</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To be done <strong>during Lecture 11</strong>. Duration: <strong>30 minutes</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>During the session</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each student will be assigned a product from another team to test.</li>
  <li>Download the latest jar file from the team's GitHub page. <mark>Copy it to an empty folder</mark>.</li>
  <li>Test the product based on the user guide. First, <em>acceptance test</em> it from the perspective of the target user profile. If there is any time left, you can switch to <em>system testing</em> mode.</li>
  <li>Post bugs you find in the team's issue tracker.
    <ul>
      <li>Each bug should be a separate issue.</li>
      <li>Even problems in the user guide <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. lack of explanations</span> can be posted as issues.</li>
      <li>Feel free to <mark>post other suggestions for improvements</mark> too <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. ways to improve the command format</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><mark>Do not use the session time to read bug reports your team is receiving.</mark></li>
  <li>Before posting a report/suggestion, check if it is already posted by someone else. If it is, post in the same thread to confirm/support the issue and add your input.</li>
  <li>Use descriptive titles for the issues. Give a good description of the bug/suggestion, including steps required to reproduce.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Attendance is strongly encouraged</strong> but not compulsory. Your participation in the session benefits your team because the number of testers testing your product will depend on how many members of your team is taking part in testing
    <span
      class="dimmed">¬†e.g. if 3 members of your team are taking part in testing, three other testers will be assigned to test your product</span>.</li>
  <li>There is <strong>no penalty for bugs reported</strong> at this session.</li>
  <li>The <strong>reward for reporting bugs</strong> or suggesting features: do <mark>include it in your <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v1.4-ppp">project portfolio page</trigger></mark> to show how you contributed to another project.</li>
