    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author github-ID</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>. The comment syntax may vary based on file type e.g. for markdown, fxml, html</p>
        <pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;!-- @@author github-ID --&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>Here is a sample code file:</p>
        <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author sarahkhoo
method 3 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code a person wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code> tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author.<br>          However, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub ID) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote, if you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours. The author of that code segment can add the GitHub ID to the
          empty tag later.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><mark>Claim only significant size code blocks that can be reviewed on its own</mark><span class="dimmed">¬†e.g., a class, a sequence of methods, a  method, a bock of statements, a composite statement such as a loop or an if-else statement</span>.
          If a code block was touched by more than one person, the <code>//@@author</code> tag should indicate the person who wrote most of that code block.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>‚ùóÔ∏è We recommend that you <strong>do not claim credit for tiny/trivial code fragments</strong> as it will pollute your code with too many <code>@@author</code> tags.</li>
          <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to collate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
          <li>üí° GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/"><em>blame</em> feature and a <em>history</em></a> feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments as only the content below that tag will be collated.<br> üëé‚§µÔ∏è
        </p>
        <pre class="hljs"><code>/**

      <li>
        <p>If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code></li>
          <li>Move unused files (or copies of files containing unused code) to that folder.</li>
          <li>use <code>//@@author github-ID</code> to mark unused code in those files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>e.g.</p>
        <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe-unused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
        <p>Please put a comment in the code to explain why it was not used.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><mark>The <code>//@@author</code> tag should be used to mark <em>all</em> code/test you claim credit for. There is no need to mark documentation files.</mark> You will be penalized if you try to boost the length of your collated files using dubious
          means such as duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even repetitive code blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.<br>          Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice a team member claiming credit for code that he/she did not write, you can email us (after the final submission) to let
          us know.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

      <li><strong>INCLUDE</strong>:

          <li>
            <p><strong>All code/test-related work you contributed</strong>. e.g. comments, test code, styling (e.g. css), xml, even test data files. But do not include chunks of text that were trivially copy pasted e.g. a test data file with 1000 persons
              that was used to test performance.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Code you reused</strong> from elsewhere: Mark such code as <code>//@@author github-ID-reused</code></p>

            <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe-reused

            <p><strong>Documentation files</strong> (User guide, Developer guide etc.). Those will be evaluated under a different category.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Code generated by the IDE/framework.</strong> You may also mark such code <code>//@@author generated</code></p>

            <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author generated
method 1 ...

          <li>
            <p><strong>Code you modified in minor ways</strong> e.g. adding a parameter. These can be left out of collated code but can be mentioned in the Project Portfolio page if you want to claim credit for them.</p>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="8">
      <li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Objectives</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To train you</strong> to do manual testing, bug reporting, bug triaging, bug fixing, communicating with users, evaluating products etc. (Note: <mark>you will be doing a graded acceptance testing session in week 13</mark>; this session will
        serve as practice for that)</li>
      <li><strong>To help you improve your product</strong> before the final submission.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>When, where</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To be done <strong>during Lecture 11</strong>. Duration: <strong>30 minutes</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>During the session</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each student will be assigned a product from another team to test.</li>
      <li>Download the latest jar file from the team's GitHub page. <mark>Copy it to an empty folder</mark>.</li>
      <li>Test the product based on the user guide. First, <em>acceptance test</em> it from the perspective of the target user profile. If there is any time left, you can switch to <em>system testing</em> mode.</li>
      <li>Post bugs you find in the team's issue tracker.
        <ul>
          <li>Each bug should be a separate issue.</li>
          <li>Even problems in the user guide <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. lack of explanations</span> can be posted as issues.</li>
          <li>Feel free to <mark>post other suggestions for improvements</mark> too <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. ways to improve the command format</span>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><mark>Do not use the session time to read bug reports your team is receiving.</mark></li>
      <li>Before posting a report/suggestion, check if it is already posted by someone else. If it is, post in the same thread to confirm/support the issue and add your input.</li>
      <li>Use descriptive titles for the issues. Give a good description of the bug/suggestion, including steps required to reproduce.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Grading</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Attendance is strongly encouraged</strong> but not compulsory. Your participation in the session benefits your team because the number of testers testing your product will depend on how many members of your team is taking part in testing
        <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. if 3 members of your team are taking part in testing, three other testers will be assigned to test your product</span>.</li>
      <li>There is <strong>no penalty for bugs reported</strong> at this session.</li>
      <li>The <strong>reward for reporting bugs</strong> or suggesting features: do <mark>include it in your <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v1.4-ppp">project portfolio page</trigger></mark> to show how you contributed to another project.</li>
