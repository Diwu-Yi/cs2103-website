`rc` = Release Candidate

### v1.5rc Project Management

We strongly recommend you to **freeze features** after reaching this milestone. As this is a release candidate, it should have all the features you intend to release at v1.5. Adding more features after this point is risky. The remaining time should be left aside for fixing problems discovered late.  

### v1.5rc Product

* Increase code coverage by adding more tests if it is lower than the level you would like it to be.
* After you have sufficient code coverage, fix remaining code quality problems and bring up the quality to your target level.

**Submission**: as before.

**Grading**: as before.

### v1.5rc Documentation

Update to match the product.

<tip-box type="important"> 

**Each member must create a _Project Portfolio_ page** to describe your contribution to the project. Follow the [example in the AddressBook-Level4](https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/team/johndoe.html).

</tip-box>

**Submission**: Must be included in the version tagged `v1.5rc`. 

### v1.5rc Demo

* Duration: ~3 minutes (max) per person %%&nbsp; a 4-member team will have 12 minutes%%
* Organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole. Unlike in v1.2-v1.4 demos, there is no need for each person to demo their own features.
* It ==should be a 'well prepared' demo==. You should know in advance exactly what you'll do in the demo.
* It is ==a _sitting down_ demo==: You'll be demonstrating the features using the TV while sitting down.
* It will be uninterrupted demo: The tutor will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish within the given time.
* The app should be populated with a significant amount of realistic data at the start. e.g at least 20 contacts.
