### v1.5rc Project Management

We strongly recommend you to **freeze features** after reaching this milestone. As this is a release candidate, it should have all the features you intend to release at v1.5. Adding major changes after this point is risky. The remaining time is better spent fixing problems discovered late or on fine-tuning the product.  

### v1.5rc Product

* As before, you can continue to add more enhancements.
* Also, consider increasing code coverage by adding more tests if it is lower than the level you would like it to be. Take note of <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v15rc-testingExpectations">our expectation on test code</trigger>. 
* After you have sufficient code coverage, fix remaining code quality problems and bring up the quality to your target level.

<modal large title="Textbook {{ icon_embedding }} Implementation →" id="modal:v15-codeQuality">
  <include src="../book/codeQuality/index.md"/>
</modal>

**Submission**: as before.

### v1.5rc Documentation

Update to match the product.

<tip-box type="important"> 

**Each member must create a _Project Portfolio_ page** to describe your contribution to the project. 

</tip-box>

<tip-box> 
  <include src="projectPortfolioPage.md" />
</tip-box>

**Submission**: Must be included in the version tagged `v1.5rc`. 

### v1.5rc Demo

* Objective: to serve as a rehearsal for the final project demo at v1.5
* ==Follow <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v15rc-demo-instructions">final demo instructions</trigger>== as much as possible.
* **Cover all features**, not just the ones added in the recent iteration.
* It **should be a 'well prepared' demo**. You should know in advance exactly what you'll do in the demo.
