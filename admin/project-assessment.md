Note that project grading is ==not competitive (not bell curved)==. ==CS2103T projects will be assessed separately from CS2103 projects.== This is to account for the perceived difference in workload. Given below is the marking scheme.

**Total**: 50 marks (:bust_in_silhouette: 40 individual marks + :busts_in_silhouette::busts_in_silhouette: 10 team marks)

<panel header="1. **Product features** [:busts_in_silhouette::busts_in_silhouette:][5 marks]" expanded>

Evaluates: How well do your features fit together to form a cohesive product (not how many features or how big the features are)?

Based on: user guide and the product demo. The **quality of the demo will be factored in** as well.

:exclamation: ‘Half-baked’ (i.e. not production quality) or 'ill-fitting' (feature does not go well with the other features) features will not earn marks at all and could even be penalized. It may be better to remove such features before submission.

</panel>

<panel header="2. **Implementation** [:bust_in_silhouette:][20 marks]" expanded>

Evaluates: How good your implementation is, in terms of the ==quality and the quantity== of the code you have written yourself.  

Based on: an inspection of the collated code (submitted in your `/collated/*.md` files).

</panel>

<panel header="3. **QA** [:bust_in_silhouette:][10 marks]" expanded>

Evaluates: How good is your Quality Assurance? 

Based on: 1. your test code 2. our own manual testing 3. your performance in the <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:projectAssessment-practicalExam">v1.5 Practical Exam</trigger>, 4. bugs found during testathon.

Criteria:
* Good use of GitHub milestones.
* Good use of GitHub release mechanism.
* Good version control, based on the repo.
* Reasonable attempt to use the forking workflow.
* Good task definition, assignment and tracking, based on the issue tracker.
