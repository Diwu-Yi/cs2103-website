Note that project grading is ==not competitive (not bell curved)==. ==CS2103T projects will be assessed separately from CS2103 projects.== This is to account for the perceived difference in workload. Given below is the marking scheme.

**Total**: 50 marks (:bust_in_silhouette: 40 individual marks + :busts_in_silhouette: 10 team marks)

<panel header="1. **Product features** [:busts_in_silhouette:][5 marks]" expanded>

Evaluates: How well do your features fit together to form a cohesive product (not how many features or how big the features are)?

Based on: user guide and the product demo. The **quality of the demo will be factored in** as well.

:exclamation: ‘Half-baked’ (i.e. not production quality) or 'ill-fitting' (feature does not go well with the other features) features will not earn marks at all and could even be penalized. It may be better to remove such features before submission.

</panel>

<panel header="2. **Implementation** [:bust_in_silhouette:][20 marks]" expanded>

Evaluates: How good your implementation is, in terms of the ==quality and the quantity== of the code you have written yourself.  

Based on: an inspection of the collated code (submitted in your `/collated/*.md` files).

</panel>

<panel header="3. **QA** [:bust_in_silhouette:][10 marks]" expanded>

Evaluates: How good is your Quality Assurance? 

Based on: 1. your test code 2. our own manual testing 3. your performance in the <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:projectAssessment-practicalExam">v1.5 Practical Exam</trigger>, 4. bugs found during testathon. 

<panel type="seamless" header="Expectations for writing automated tests:" expanded>

<panel header="4. **Documentation** [:bust_in_silhouette:][10 marks]" expanded>

Evaluates: How well does your user guide achieves its objectives? 

Based on: the relevant sections of your project portfolio. Criteria considered:
* Explanation should be clear and written to match the audience.
* Good use of visuals to complement text.
    
</panel>
  
<panel header="5. **Project management** [:busts_in_silhouette:: 5 marks]" expanded>
<div id="project-management-grading">  

Evaluates: How well you did in project management related aspects of the project, as an individual and as a team 

Based on: Supervisor observations of weekly milestones and GitHub data. ==Marks will be deducted== if,
 * if you missed more than two individual milestones %%&nbsp;out of the six milestones v1.0 - v1.5rc%% (only the team member loses marks)
 * if your team missed more than two team milestones %%&nbsp;out of the six milestones v1.0 - v1.5rc%% (all team members lose marks)
 
Milestones ==need to be reached _before_ the start of the tutorial==. If you reach the milestone _during_ the tutorial, it will be considered as missed.
  
Other criteria:
* Good use of GitHub milestones
* Good use of GitHub release mechanism
* Good version control, based on the repo
* Reasonable attempt to use the forking workflow
* Good task definition, assignment and tracking, based on the issue tracker
* Good use of buffers %%(opposite: everything at the last minute)%%
* Project done iteratively and incrementally %%(opposite: doing most of the work in one big burst)%%
