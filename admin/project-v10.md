#### v1.0 Documentation

* **Developer Guide**:
  Have a draft of the requirements of your project, as described in mid-v1.0 progress guide.
  
* **User Guide**:  
  Write a user guide to describe what the product would be like when it is at 2.0.  We recommend that ou follow the existing <tooltip content="AddressBook-Level4">AB4</tooltip> User Guide in terms of structure and format.

  <tip-box> 
  
  :bulb: It is highly recommended that you **divide documentation work (in the User Guide and the Developer Guide) among team members based on enhancements/features each person would be adding** %%&nbsp;e.g., If you are the person planing to add a feature X, you should be the person to describe the feature X in the User Guide and in the Developer Guide%%. For features that are not planned to be implemented by v1.4, you can divide them based on who will be implementing them _if_ the project were to continue until v2.0 (hypothetically).
  
  %%Reason: In the final project evaluation your documentation skills will be graded based on sections of the User/Developer Guide you have written.%%
    
  </tip-box>


**Suggested length**: Follow the existing user guide and developer guides in terms of the level of details.

**Submission**: Show to the tutor during the tutorial.
