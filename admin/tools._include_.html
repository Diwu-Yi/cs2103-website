<p><strong>Collaboration platform</strong>: You are <mark><em>required to</em> use GitHub</mark> as the hosting and collaboration platform of your project (i.e., to hold the Code repository, Issue Tracker, etc.). See <a href="/website/admin/index.html#admin-appendixE-github">Appendix E</a>  for more info on how to setup and use GitHub for your project.</p>
<div id="communication">
  <p><strong>Communication</strong>: Keeping a record of communications among your team can help you, and us, in many ways. We encourage you to do at least some of the project communication in written medium (e.g., GitHub Issue Tracker) to practice how to
    communicate technical things in written form.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Instead of the IVLE forum, we encourage you to <mark>post your questions/suggestions in this <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/forum/issues">github/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/forum</a></mark>.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, you can post in our slack channel <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s2.slack.com">https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s2.slack.com</a>. We encourage you all to <mark>join the slack channel</mark> (you'll need to use an email address ending in
      <code>@nus.edu.sg</code>, <code>@comp.nus.edu.sg</code>, <code>@u.nus.edu.sg</code> or <code>@u.nus.edu</code> to join this channel).</li>
    <li>Note that slack is useful for quick chats while issue tracker is useful for longer-running conversations.</li>
    <li>You are encouraged to use channels with a wider audience (common channel in slack, GitHub issue tracker) for module-related communication as much as possible, rather than private channels such as private slack/FB messages or direct emails. <span class="dimmed">Rationale: more classmates can benefit from the discussions</span>.</li>
  </ul>

<p><strong>IDE</strong>: You are recommended to use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij IDEA</a> for module-related programming work. You may use the community edition (free) or the ultimate edition (free for students). While the use of Intellij
  is not compulsory, note that module materials are optimized for Intellij. Use other IDEs at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Revision control</strong>: You are <mark><em>required to</em> use Git</mark>. Other revision control software are not allowed.<br> The recommended GUI client for Git is <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> (which comes bundled
  with Git), but you may use any other, or none.</p>
